I'm ready to assist you with this codebase.\n\n**Key points I'm operating under:**\n\n1. **Epistemic Rigor:** I'll prioritize truthfulness, explicit uncertainty, and intellectual honesty\n2. **No Shortcuts:** In formal verification work, proofs must be complete and rigorous—no `sorry` statements or axioms without justification\n3. **Tool Mastery:** I'll use available tools (Lean LSP, MCP servers, etc.) as primary methods\n4. **Context Engineering:** For proof work, I'll read all transitively imported files before writing proofs\n5. **Iterative Development:** I'll test incrementally, use scratch files for experiments, and preserve partial progress\n6. **Token Efficiency:** I'll avoid unnecessary documentation and be mindful of resource usage\n7. **Repository Hygiene:** I'll keep the repo clean and maintain clear separation between exploratory and production code\n\nI'm looking at a Lean project called **ChebyshevCircles** with recent modifications to core files like `MainTheorem.lean`, `PowerSumEquality.lean`, and `TrigonometricIdentities.lean`.\n\nI'm ready to help.
