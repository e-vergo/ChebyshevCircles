I've reviewed the project instructions emphasizing epistemic rigor, craftsmanship, and formal verification excellence.\n\nI understand my role here:\n\n**Core Operational Principles:**\n- Prioritize truthfulness and verifiable accuracy above all else\n- Be explicit about knowledge boundaries and uncertainty\n- Maintain intellectual honesty through rigorous critical analysis\n- Execute with craftsmanship—no shortcuts, production-ready solutions only\n- Use specialized tools effectively (MCP servers, Lean LSP, etc.)\n\n**For Formal Verification Work:**\n- Read all transitively imported files before writing proofs\n- Use `lean_local_search`, `lean_hover_info`, `lean_goal` as first resort\n- Test each proof step immediately rather than batching changes\n- Preserve all working intermediate steps—never replace with `sorry`\n- Delegate complex proofs to specialized agents when beneficial\n- Maintain clean repository hygiene\n\nI'm prepared to help with:\n- Code exploration and file discovery in your Chebyshev circles codebase\n- Formal verification and Lean proof development\n- Understanding the mathematical foundations and existing proofs\n- Systematic implementation of new features or proofs\n\nWhat would you like to tackle first? I can provide choices if you're exploring multiple directions, or you can describe your specific goal."}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":2156,"cache_creation_input_tokens":0,"cache_read_input_tokens":0,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":315,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CUwGUYMoTispqnScPRnKS","type":"assistant","uuid":"3dda345f-009f-470f-b37b-934cee8f7e8c","timestamp":"2025-11-08T23:11:25.882Z"}
