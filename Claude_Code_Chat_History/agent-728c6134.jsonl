I understand the core principles guiding this work:\n\n- **Epistemic rigor**: truthfulness and verifiable accuracy above all\n- **Craftsmanship**: production-ready solutions, no shortcuts\n- **Formal verification standards**: no `sorry` statements in final deliverables\n- **Operational efficiency**: strategic use of tools, clean repository hygiene\n- **Intellectual honesty**: explicit about uncertainty and knowledge boundaries\n\nI can see the repository is currently on the `main` branch with some modified files (CLAUDE.md, MainTheorem.lean, PolynomialConstruction.lean, README.md).\n\nWhat would you like me to help you with? I can:\n\n1. Explore and analyze the Chebyshev circles codebase\n2. Search for specific lemmas, theorems, or proof patterns\n3. Work on formal verification tasks in Lean\n4. Investigate files or understand the project structure\n5. Help with proof development or debugging\n\nPlease let me know what you'd like to focus on."}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":2204,"cache_creation_input_tokens":0,"cache_read_input_tokens":0,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":244,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CUvoLMsuAHhYQAyaZEmRi","type":"assistant","uuid":"3f3fef00-5cdd-47f0-985a-cdee923b52a0","timestamp":"2025-11-08T17:15:30.541Z"}
