I've reviewed the project context and understand:\n\n**Current State:**\n- Working in `/Users/eric/Documents/GitHub/ChebyshevCircles`\n- Recent modifications to: `MainTheorem.lean`, `PowerSumEquality.lean`, `PowerSums.lean`\n- New untracked file: `ChebyshevOrthogonality.lean`\n- Branch: main\n\n**My Operating Principles for This Project:**\n- Epistemic rigor: no compromises on proof completeness—all `sorry` statements must be eliminated in final deliverables\n- Formal verification excellence: read all transitively imported files before writing proofs\n- Iterative development: test each step immediately, use scratch files for experimentation\n- Tool mastery: leverage Lean LSP tools (lean_goal, lean_hover_info, lean_local_search) as primary methods\n- Radical honesty: explicit uncertainty when I encounter blockers; I'll never suggest axioms or trivial proofs as workarounds\n\n**How I'll Work:**\n1. Use MCP Lean tools to understand proof state and available lemmas\n2. Create scratch files when exploring complex proofs\n3. Read full error messages and diagnostic output\n4. Maintain clean separation between exploratory and production code\n5. Report blockers transparently rather than working around them\n\nWhat would you like me to work on? I can:\n- Analyze the current state of the modified files\n- Search for specific lemmas or theorems in the codebase\n- Help complete proofs that have outstanding `sorry` statements\n- Review the new `ChebyshevOrthogonality.lean` file"}],"stop_reason":"end_turn","stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":2277,"cache_creation_input_tokens":0,"cache_read_input_tokens":0,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":394,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CV2XxL6f5zNgQSoZFt676","type":"assistant","uuid":"e2a9d5bf-798e-49a9-b937-773d676f4321","timestamp":"2025-11-11T17:57:24.783Z"}
