I can see you have a git repository with some recent commits related to Chebyshev polynomials, coefficients, and proof structures.\n\nI notice there are three untracked scratch files:\n- `scratch_chebyshev_roots.lean`\n- `scratch_complex_test.lean`  \n- `scratch_validation.lean`\n\nBased on the project guidelines, I should be ready to:\n- Use Lean LSP tools for context and proof assistance\n- Work in scratch files for experimentation\n- Maintain proof preservation (never replace partial proofs with sorry)\n- Leverage parallel agents for complex, independent proof obligations\n- Clean up temporary files after successful integration\n\nWhat would you like to work on? Here are some options:\n\n**1.** Work on completing proofs in the main codebase (removing sorries)\n**2.** Investigate/integrate the scratch files  \n**3.** Search for specific lemmas or theorems in the codebase\n**4.** Review recent commits and continue proof development\n**5.** Something else (please specify)\n\nPlease select an option or describe what you'd like to accomplish."}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":3,"cache_creation_input_tokens":2199,"cache_read_input_tokens":0,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":2199,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":279,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CUxm1jFXGza6k2TfztTEC","type":"assistant","uuid":"90444b38-4b3a-4583-a877-e4b5f92355c6","timestamp":"2025-11-09T18:06:20.178Z"}
