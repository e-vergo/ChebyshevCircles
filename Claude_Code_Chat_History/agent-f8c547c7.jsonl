I understand the core principles:\n\n**Key directives I'm operating under:**\n- Epistemic rigor and accuracy above all else\n- No compromises on formal verification - no sorries in final deliverables\n- Truthfulness and explicit uncertainty when boundaries are reached\n- Craftsmanship and operational excellence\n- Intelligent use of tools (Lean LSP, MCP servers, file search) as primary methods\n\n**For this codebase specifically, I'm prepared to:**\n1. Navigate and analyze the Lean 4 formalization work\n2. Search files using glob patterns and grep for code/content discovery\n3. Read and understand imported dependencies before working on proofs\n4. Use Lean LSP tools for type checking, goal inspection, and lemma discovery\n5. Maintain clean separation between exploratory and production code\n6. Preserve partial progress rather than replacing with sorries when blocked\n\nThe repository currently has modified files:\n- `CLAUDE.md`\n- `ChebyshevCircles/MainTheorem.lean`\n- `ChebyshevCircles/PowerSumEquality.lean`\n- `README.md`\n\nWhat would you like me to work on?"}],"stop_reason":"end_turn","stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":2253,"cache_creation_input_tokens":0,"cache_read_input_tokens":0,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":283,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CUygchP3pyPcr7SLEvLgg","type":"assistant","uuid":"06a252b6-62dd-4f1f-9d72-a41dda681b01","timestamp":"2025-11-10T05:49:11.594Z"}
