I've reviewed the context:\n\n**Current State:**\n- Working in `/Users/eric/Documents/GitHub/ChebyshevCircles`\n- Active git branch: `main`\n- Modified file: `ChebyshevCircles/MainTheorem.lean`\n- Untracked scratch files: `MainTheorem_scratch{1,4,5,6}.lean`\n\n**I understand the operational principles:**\n- Epistemic rigor and accuracy are paramount\n- No compromises on formal proofs (no `sorry` in final deliverables)\n- Craftsmanship over speed; token efficiency matters\n- Use scratch files for experimental work, clean up when done\n- Leverage specialized tools (MCP lean-lsp) for proof work\n- Keep partial progress rather than discarding incomplete work\n\n**Ready to help with:**\n- Formal proof development in Lean\n- Codebase navigation and file search\n- Proof state analysis and debugging\n- Lemma discovery via semantic/syntactic search\n- Multi-step problem coordination\n\nWhat would you like to work on? I can help you:\n1. Continue developing proofs in `MainTheorem.lean`\n2. Investigate the scratch files to consolidate work\n3. Search for specific lemmas or proof patterns\n4. Analyze the overall project structure\n\nWhat's your priority?"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":2246,"cache_creation_input_tokens":0,"cache_read_input_tokens":0,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":319,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CUwkwWRjRXKoHkwwfVLFS","type":"assistant","uuid":"f644c481-89be-4b13-a760-9cc0a4695a46","timestamp":"2025-11-09T05:24:42.503Z"}
