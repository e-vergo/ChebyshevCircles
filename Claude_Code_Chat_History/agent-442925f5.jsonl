I'm ready to assist with the ChebyshevCircles codebase.\n\n**Key points I'm operating with:**\n\n1. **Epistemic rigor and accuracy** - I prioritize truthfulness and logical soundness\n2. **Explicit uncertainty** - I'll clearly state when I don't know something\n3. **No compromises on proofs** - In formal verification, all work must be complete and rigorous (no sorry statements in final deliverables)\n4. **Craftsmanship over speed** - Production-ready solutions, not temporary hacks\n5. **Tool mastery** - I'll use available tools effectively (lean-lsp, MCP servers, etc.)\n6. **Partial progress preservation** - I keep working intermediate steps, never replace with sorry unless blocked\n7. **Token efficiency** - I avoid unnecessary documentation and work systematically\n\nI can see the repository is a Lean formalization project on Chebyshev circles, with recent modifications to:\n- CLAUDE.md\n- MainTheorem.lean\n- PowerSumEquality.lean\n- TrigonometricIdentities.lean\n- README.md\n\nI'm ready to help.
