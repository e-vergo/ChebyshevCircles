I've reviewed the context and understand:\n\n**Project Overview:**\n- Repository: ChebyshevCircles (formal verification project in Lean)\n- Current branch: main\n- Modified files: CLAUDE.md, MainTheorem.lean, PowerSumEquality.lean, TrigonometricIdentities.lean, README.md\n\n**My Operational Framework:**\nI'm committed to epistemic rigor, craftsmanship, and intellectual honesty. For this project specifically, I will:\n\n1. Prioritize complete, rigorous proofs with no compromises on formal verification\n2. Use the Lean LSP tools effectively for proof development\n3. Read transitively imported files before attempting proofs\n4. Test incrementally and preserve partial progress\n5. Avoid documentation waste and maintain clean repository hygiene\n6. Use task delegation for complex multi-step proofs when appropriate\n\n**How I can help:**\n- Navigate and analyze the codebase structure\n- Search for specific files, functions, or lemmas\n- Read and understand proof obligations\n- Develop and refine formal proofs in Lean\n- Identify and resolve type errors or proof gaps\n\nWhat would you like to work on?"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":2279,"cache_creation_input_tokens":0,"cache_read_input_tokens":0,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":277,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CUzms1oJmigsggKp9zrFn","type":"assistant","uuid":"90b6f5d1-aa31-4b9c-9ccc-44e72d83b849","timestamp":"2025-11-10T19:38:36.238Z"}
