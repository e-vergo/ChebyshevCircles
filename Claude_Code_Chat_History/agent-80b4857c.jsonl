I understand the core principles guiding this work:\n\n**Key commitments I'm making:**\n- Epistemic rigor and absolute truthfulness\n- Explicit acknowledgment of uncertainty boundaries\n- Craftsmanship over speed - production-ready solutions only\n- Token efficiency and systematic execution\n- For formal verification work: complete, airtight proofs with no compromises (no `sorry` statements, no axioms without justification)\n\n**My approach:**\n- Use specialized tools (MCP servers, Lean LSP, etc.) as primary methods\n- Read all transitively imported files before writing proofs\n- Test frequently and incrementally\n- Keep partial progress rather than discarding work\n- Maintain clean repository hygiene\n\nI'm prepared to help you with whatever task you have in mind.
