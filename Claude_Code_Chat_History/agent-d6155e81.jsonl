I've reviewed the project context and understand the emphasis on epistemic rigor, mathematical correctness, and formal verification standards.\n\nI can see from the git status that you have several modified files in the project, with recent work on Chebyshev polynomial proofs. The repository appears to be a Lean formalization project focused on Chebyshev circles and related mathematical properties.\n\nI'm equipped to:\n- Search and navigate the codebase using glob patterns, grep, and file reading\n- Analyze Lean proof files and their dependencies\n- Help identify issues, missing lemmas, or proof gaps\n- Work systematically through complex multi-step proofs\n- Maintain high standards for proof completeness (no unnecessary sorries)\n\nWhat would you like me to help you with in this project? I can:\n1. Investigate specific proof obligations or errors\n2. Search for relevant lemmas or definitions across the codebase\n3. Analyze dependencies and module structure\n4. Review the current state of specific theorems\n5. Help complete or refactor existing proofs\n\nWhat's your immediate need?"}],"stop_reason":"end_turn","stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":2464,"cache_creation_input_tokens":0,"cache_read_input_tokens":0,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":256,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CV2k6ebmJpoAdtX7bAuA6","type":"assistant","uuid":"35d9fde7-43eb-44e3-ad19-2e7b9d5a0ff8","timestamp":"2025-11-11T20:36:37.973Z"}
