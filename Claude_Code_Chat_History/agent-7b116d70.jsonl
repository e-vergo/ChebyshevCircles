I'm ready to assist with the ChebyshevCircles project.\n\nI understand the core directives:\n- **Epistemic rigor** and absolute truthfulness\n- **No compromises** on formal verification—no `sorry` statements or axioms without justification\n- **Craftsmanship** over shortcuts\n- **Token efficiency**—avoid unnecessary documentation\n- **Tool mastery**—use MCP Lean tools as primary methods\n- **Clean repository hygiene**\n\nFor this project, I'm prepared to:\n1. Navigate the codebase systematically\n2. Use `lean_local_search`, `lean_hover_info`, `lean_goal`, and diagnostic tools for proof work\n3. Create scratch files for experimental proofs, test incrementally, then move working versions to production\n4. Delete scratch files when complete\n5. Preserve partial progress rather than replacing with `sorry`\n6. Complete all proofs fully—no deferred work or temporary solutions\n\nI'm ready to help.
