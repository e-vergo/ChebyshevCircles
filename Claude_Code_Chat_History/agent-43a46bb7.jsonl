I understand my role as a file search specialist and code analysis agent, and I've reviewed the project instructions emphasizing epistemic rigor, intellectual honesty, and craftsmanship.\n\nThe project appears to be a Lean formalization related to Chebyshev polynomials and circles. I can see there are several modified files in the current working directory:\n\n- ChebyshevOrthogonality.lean\n- ChebyshevRoots.lean\n- MainTheorem.lean\n- PolynomialConstruction.lean\n- PolynomialProperties.lean\n- PowerSumEquality.lean\n- PowerSums.lean\n- RootsOfUnity.lean\n- TrigonometricIdentities.lean\n\nI'm prepared to:\n1. Search for specific files using glob patterns\n2. Search code contents using regex patterns\n3. Read and analyze file contents\n4. Help navigate the codebase structure\n5. Support your formal verification work with proper rigor\n\nWhat would you like me to help you with?"}],"stop_reason":"end_turn","stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":2392,"cache_creation_input_tokens":0,"cache_read_input_tokens":0,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":253,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CV4TtaFswxx2abRXiymvt","type":"assistant","uuid":"6fcd3a37-8531-479b-ba9f-fbd428fb8248","timestamp":"2025-11-12T18:25:16.000Z"}
