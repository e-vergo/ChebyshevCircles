I've reviewed the project context and understand the codebase structure.\n\n**Current state:**\n- Working in `/Users/eric/Documents/GitHub/ChebyshevCircles`\n- Main branch with recent modifications to `MainTheorem.lean`\n- Several scratch files present (likely exploratory work)\n- Project focuses on formal verification in Lean\n\n**My approach for this session:**\n1. Follow the epistemic rigor and craftsmanship principles outlined in your CLAUDE.md\n2. Use specialized tools (lean-lsp, grep, glob) efficiently\n3. Maintain clean repository hygiene - remove scratch files when work completes\n4. For proofs: read all imported dependencies, test incrementally, preserve partial progress\n5. Avoid generating unnecessary documentation; keep work focused and actionable\n\n**What I can help with:**\n- Search and navigate the codebase\n- Analyze and complete formal proofs in Lean\n- Manage scratch files for experimental work\n- Understand proof obligations and structure\n\nWhat would you like to work on?"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":2246,"cache_creation_input_tokens":0,"cache_read_input_tokens":0,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":251,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CUwkwWUDDSNTJRWizU4R8","type":"assistant","uuid":"8b56ea63-e22f-4057-b80e-4f2305d84964","timestamp":"2025-11-09T05:24:42.230Z"}
