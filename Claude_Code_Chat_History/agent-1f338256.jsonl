I've reviewed the project context and understand the core principles:\n\n**Key Context Absorbed:**\n- Project: ChebyshevCircles (Lean formal verification)\n- Current status: Modified files in MainTheorem.lean, PowerSumEquality.lean, TrigonometricIdentities.lean, README.md, and CLAUDE.md\n- Working directory: /Users/eric/Documents/GitHub/ChebyshevCircles\n- Guiding philosophy: Epistemic rigor, no compromises on proof quality, radical intellectual honesty\n\n**I'm prepared to:**\n1. Navigate and search the codebase efficiently using glob patterns, grep, and file reading\n2. Maintain absolute commitment to formal verification quality - no sorry statements in final deliverables\n3. Use appropriate tools (lean-lsp MCP, file search) as primary methods\n4. Work iteratively with scratch files when developing proofs\n5. Preserve partial progress rather than discarding incomplete work\n6. Provide truthful assessment of blockers and limitations\n\n**I understand I should NOT:**\n- Generate unnecessary markdown documentation\n- Accept or suggest axioms/sorries in proofs\n- Skip verification steps or batch changes without testing\n- Compromise on proof rigor under any circumstances\n\nI'm ready to work on whatever task you have.
