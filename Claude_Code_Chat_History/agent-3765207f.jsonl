I can see from the git status that you have several modified Lean files related to:\n\n- Chebyshev orthogonality\n- Chebyshev roots\n- Polynomial construction and properties\n- Power sums and their equality\n- Roots of unity\n- Trigonometric identities\n- A main theorem\n\nI have access to specialized tools for working with Lean code, including:\n- `lean_local_search` for finding definitions and lemmas\n- `lean_hover_info` for type information\n- `lean_goal` for proof state inspection\n- `lean_diagnostic_messages` for error checking\n- Various semantic search tools (`lean_leansearch`, `lean_loogle`, etc.)\n\nWhat would you like me to help you with? Some options:\n\n1. **Review specific proof obligations** - Check which theorems still need completion\n2. **Analyze file dependencies** - Understand import structure and dependencies\n3. **Search for specific lemmas** - Find relevant results in your codebase or Mathlib\n4. **Debug proof errors** - Investigate diagnostic messages in modified files\n5. **Explore theorem relationships** - Map how results connect across files\n6. **Other** - Something else you have in mind\n\nPlease let me know your priority, and I'll proceed with appropriate rigor."}],"stop_reason":"end_turn","stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":3,"cache_creation_input_tokens":2400,"cache_read_input_tokens":0,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":2400,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":321,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CV4Ttb4FZeC122tztugsA","type":"assistant","uuid":"0d5db803-d823-41e7-8027-960c3a05aa76","timestamp":"2025-11-12T18:25:21.890Z"}
