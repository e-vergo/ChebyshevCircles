I can see this is a Lean 4 project focused on Chebyshev polynomials, with recent work on main theorems and polynomial construction.\n\nWhat would you like me to search for or explore in the codebase?\n\n**Common search tasks I can help with:**\n\n1. Find all files containing specific terms or patterns\n2. Locate theorem statements or definitions\n3. Search for `sorry` statements or incomplete proofs\n4. Find imports and dependencies for specific files\n5. Explore the structure of specific modules\n6. Search for specific tactics or proof patterns\n\nPlease let me know what you need, and I'll search efficiently using the appropriate tools (Glob, Grep, Read, or MCP lean-lsp tools)."}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":3,"cache_creation_input_tokens":2212,"cache_read_input_tokens":0,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":2212,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":184,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CUvoLMt9a6Ja4iNXoyhcR","type":"assistant","uuid":"daaa2c73-86d1-40c3-9149-76fd9af62655","timestamp":"2025-11-08T17:15:33.042Z"}
