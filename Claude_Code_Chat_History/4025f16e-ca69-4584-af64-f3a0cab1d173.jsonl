This provides a bridge between:\n- **Discrete geometry** (roots of unity on the circle)\n- **Harmonic analysis** (discrete orthogonality relations)\n- **Polynomial theory** (Chebyshev polynomials)\n\n## Project Organization\n\nThis project is split into two main components: (1) Python scripts used to generate animated gifs visualizing the behavior that results from the proof statement, and (2) A complete verification structured into 10 modules totaling 3,457 lines of Lean 4 code:\n\n| Module | Lines | Purpose |\n|--------|-------|---------|\n| [RootsOfUnity.lean](ChebyshevCircles/RootsOfUnity.lean) | 108 | Root definitions and list properties |\n| [PolynomialConstruction.lean](ChebyshevCircles/PolynomialConstruction.lean) | 541 | Polynomial construction from roots |\n| [TrigonometricIdentities.lean](ChebyshevCircles/TrigonometricIdentities.lean) | 137 | Trigonometric sum identities |\n| [ChebyshevRoots.lean](ChebyshevCircles/ChebyshevRoots.lean) | 235 | Chebyshev root characterization |\n| [PowerSums.lean](ChebyshevCircles/PowerSums.lean) | 705 | Power sum φ-invariance |\n| [NewtonIdentities.lean](ChebyshevCircles/NewtonIdentities.lean) | 317 | Newton's identities framework |\n| [PolynomialProperties.lean](ChebyshevCircles/PolynomialProperties.lean) | 130 | Polynomial degree and coefficient properties |\n| [PowerSumEquality.lean](ChebyshevCircles/PowerSumEquality.lean) | 273 | General power sum equality |\n| [ChebyshevOrthogonality.lean](ChebyshevCircles/ChebyshevOrthogonality.lean) | 538 | Discrete orthogonality relations |\n| [MainTheorem.lean](ChebyshevCircles/MainTheorem.lean) | 473 | Main theorem and supporting results |\n\n## Proof Strategy\n\nThe verification follows a carefully structured approach:\n\n**Step 1: Root Characterization**\nBoth the rotated roots and Chebyshev roots can be expressed as cosines of equally-spaced angles (modulo phase shifts). This parallel structure is established in `ChebyshevRoots.lean`.\n\n**Step 2: Power Sum Invariance**\nThe key insight: For any polynomial, power sums of its roots determine all coefficients (via Newton's identities). We prove in `PowerSums.lean` that:\n```lean\n∑_{k=0}^{N-1} cos(φ + 2πk/N)^m = ∑_{k=0}^{N-1} cos(2πk/N)^m\n```\nfor all m > 0. This shows the rotated roots and unrotated roots have identical power sums (except m=0).\n\n**Step 3: Discrete Orthogonality**\nThe power sum equality relies on discrete orthogonality of complex exponentials over N-th roots of unity. `ChebyshevOrthogonality.lean` proves:\n```lean\n∑_{k=0}^{N-1} exp(i·j·2πk/N) = 0  (when j ≠ 0 mod N)\n```\nThis is the discrete analog of continuous Fourier orthogonality.\n\n**Step 4: Newton's Identities**\n`NewtonIdentities.lean` implements the bridge between power sums and elementary symmetric polynomials (which determine polynomial coefficients). For polynomials of the same degree with identical power sums (except the 0-th), all coefficients match except the constant term.\n\n**Step 5: Assembly**\n`MainTheorem.lean` combines these results: since scaled polynomials from rotated and unrotated roots have identical non-constant coefficients and the same degree, they differ only by a constant. The unrotated case (φ=0) is shown to equal T_N.\n\n**Technical Challenges Overcome:**\n- Handling complex/real conversions in power sum computations\n- Proving non-degeneracy of roots (no duplicates) for polynomial construction\n- Managing index arithmetic modulo N in discrete sums\n- Careful degree tracking to apply Newton's identities correctly\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n**Mathematical Background:**\n- Undergraduate algebra: polynomials, roots, symmetric functions\n- Complex numbers and exponentials\n- Trigonometric identities\n- Familiarity with orthogonal polynomials (helpful but not required)\n\n**Software Requirements:**\n- [Lean 4](https://leanprover.github.io/) (v4.25.0-rc2)\n- [Lake](https://github.com/leanprover/lake) (Lean's build tool, included with Lean)\n- [Python 3.7+](https://www.python.org/) (for visualizations only)\n\n**Expected Build Time:** ~5-10 minutes on first build (compiles Mathlib dependencies)\n\n## Installation\n\n### Lean 4 Verification\n\n1. **Install Lean 4:**\n   ```bash\n   # Via elan (recommended)\n   curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leanprover/elan/master/elan-init.sh -sSf | sh\n   ```\n\n2. **Clone and build:**\n   ```bash\n   git clone https://github.com/e-vergo/ChebyshevCircles.git\n   cd ChebyshevCircles\n   lake exe cache get  # Download cached Mathlib builds (optional but recommended)\n   lake build\n   ```\n\n3. **Verify the proof:**\n   ```bash\n   lake build ChebyshevCircles\n   ```\n   If successful, all 3,457 lines of proof are verified with no `sorry` statements.\n\n### Python Visualizations\n\n1. **Create virtual environment:**\n   ```bash\n   python3 -m venv .venv\n   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\\Scripts\\activate\n   ```\n\n2. **Install dependencies:**\n   ```bash\n   pip install -r requirements.txt\n   ```\n\n3. **Generate animations:**\n   ```bash\n   python main.py\n   ```\n   This creates 6 GIF files in `chebyshev_gifs/` (one for each N ∈ {3,4,5,6,12,13}).\n\n## Usage\n\n**Explore the proofs:**\n```bash\n# Open in VS Code with Lean 4 extension\ncode ChebyshevCircles/MainTheorem.lean\n\n# Check a specific module\nlake build ChebyshevCircles.PowerSums\n\n# View generated documentation (after GitHub Pages deployment)\n# Navigate to: https://e-vergo.github.io/ChebyshevCircles/\n```\n\n**Examine proof states:**\nThe Lean 4 VS Code extension shows the proof state (goals and hypotheses) at any cursor position. Key theorems to explore:\n- `MainTheorem.lean:446` - Main theorem statement\n- `PowerSums.lean:287` - Power sum invariance\n- `ChebyshevOrthogonality.lean:412` - Discrete orthogonality\n- `NewtonIdentities.lean:156` - Newton's identities application\n\n**Customize visualizations:**\nEdit `main.py` to change:\n- `N_values` (line 156): Which roots of unity to animate\n- `num_frames` (line 161): Animation smoothness\n- `plot_x_range`, `plot_y_range` (lines 75-76): Axis ranges\n\n## Contributing\n\nThis project has completed its primary goal of verifying the main theorem. Potential extensions:\n- Generalize to Chebyshev polynomials of the second kind (U_N)\n- Prove analogous results for other orthogonal polynomial families\n- Optimize proof tactics for better maintainability\n- Add interactive web visualizations\n\nPull requests welcome. Please ensure:\n- All proofs compile with `lake build`\n- No `sorry` statements introduced\n- Code follows Mathlib style conventions\n\n## Citation\n\nIf you use this formalization in your research, please cite:\n\n```bibtex\n@misc{chebyshev-circles-2025,\n  author = {Eric},\n  title = {Chebyshev Circles: Formal Verification of Rotated Roots of Unity},\n  year = {2025},\n  publisher = {GitHub},\n  url = {https://github.com/e-vergo/ChebyshevCircles}\n}\n```\n\n## License\n\nThis project is licensed under the Apache License 2.0 - see the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file for details.\n\nCopyright (c) 2025 Eric.

What is Being Computed and Visualized\n\nThe code visualizes the **geometric construction** underlying the theorem by animating the following process:\n\n- **N-th roots of unity** positioned on the unit circle in the complex plane\n- These roots are **rotated continuously** by angle φ (from 0 to 2π)\n- The roots are **projected onto the real axis** (taking real components)\n- A **polynomial is constructed** with these projected values as roots\n- The polynomial is **scaled by 2^(N-1)**\n- The resulting polynomial curve is plotted, demonstrating that its **shape remains fixed** (the Chebyshev polynomial T_N) while only the **constant term changes** with rotation\n\n### 2. Mathematical Formulas Implemented\n\n**Roots of Unity (lines 6-16):**\n```\nω_k = e^(i·2πk/N) = cos(2πk/N) + i·sin(2πk/N)  for k = 0, ..., N-1\n```\n\n**Rotated Roots (lines 24-30):**\n```\nω_k(φ) = ω_k · e^(iφ) = e^(i(φ + 2πk/N))\n```\n\n**Projected Roots (lines 19-21):**\n```\nr_k(φ) = Re(ω_k(φ)) = cos(φ + 2πk/N)\n```\n\n**Polynomial Construction (line 71):**\n```\nP(x) = ∏_{k=0}^{N-1} (x - r_k(φ))\n```\nThis produces a monic polynomial whose coefficients are computed via NumPy's `poly()` function, which internally uses Vieta's formulas (elementary symmetric polynomials of roots).\n\n**Scaling (lines 33-38):**\n```\nS(x) = 2^(N-1) · P(x)\n```\nNote: The code uses `2^(n-2)` where `n = len(complex_coeffs)` which equals N+1 (degree N polynomial has N+1 coefficients), so the scaling factor is `2^((N+1)-2) = 2^(N-1)`. This is correct.\n\n**Polynomial Evaluation (lines 41-46):**\nUses Horner's method for efficient evaluation:\n```\nP(x) = ((...((c_0·x + c_1)·x + c_2)·x + ...) + c_n\n```\n\n### 3. How Animations Demonstrate the Theorem\n\nThe animations provide **dynamic proof-of-concept** by showing:\n\n1. **Continuous rotation**: The red points on the unit circle rotate smoothly through a full 360° cycle\n2. **Projection mapping**: Pink/red projection lines show how each root maps to the real axis\n3. **Polynomial stability**: The blue polynomial curve maintains its characteristic oscillating shape (the Chebyshev form)\n4. **Constant term variation**: Text overlay shows the constant term changing continuously while the curve shape stays fixed\n5. **Full cycle closure**: After 360° rotation, the configuration returns to initial state, demonstrating periodicity\n\n**Key visual insight**: Despite roots moving continuously, the polynomial's shape is invariant—only vertical translation occurs.\n\n### 4. Geometric Intuition Provided\n\nThe visualizations reveal several deep geometric insights:\n\n**A. Discrete Rotational Symmetry**\n- N-fold rotational symmetry of the roots means rotation by 2π/N produces an equivalent configuration (permuted roots)\n- This discrete symmetry underlies why coefficients (symmetric functions of roots) have limited freedom\n\n**B. Projection Geometry**\n- The unit circle compresses to the interval [-1, 1] under real projection\n- Rotated roots sweep out different configurations on [-1, 1], but these configurations are \"equivalent\" in a polynomial sense\n\n**C. Chebyshev Oscillation Pattern**\n- For N roots, the polynomial has N-1 extrema in [-1, 1]\n- The characteristic \"equiripple\" behavior of Chebyshev polynomials is visible: equally-spaced oscillations between ±2^(N-1)\n\n**D. Fourier/Harmonic Connection**\n- Equally-spaced points on a circle encode discrete Fourier structure\n- The invariance of polynomial shape under rotation is geometric manifestation of discrete orthogonality relations\n\n### 5. Choice of N Values and Rationale\n\n**N ∈ {3, 4, 5, 6, 12, 13}** (line 156)\n\nRationale by category:\n\n**Small N (3, 4, 5, 6):**\n- **Pedagogical clarity**: Easy to visually track individual roots\n- **Low-degree polynomials**: Curves are simple, extrema are countable\n- **Distinct behaviors**:\n  - N=3: Cubic with characteristic \"S\" shape\n  - N=4: Quartic with 3 turning points\n  - N=5: Quintic (featured in README as primary example)\n  - N=6: Sextic showing increased oscillation\n\n**Medium N (12):**\n- **Pattern emergence**: High enough to see the oscillatory pattern clearly\n- **Still visualizable**: Not so many roots that they blur together\n- **Divisibility**: 12 = 2² × 3 has many divisors, showing how different angular spacings work\n\n**Prime N (13):**\n- **No sub-symmetries**: Prime N means no proper divisors, so no finer rotational sub-symmetry\n- **Demonstrates generality**: Shows theorem isn't restricted to composite N\n- **Maximum \"generic\" behavior**: Least structured case\n\n**Omitted values**: Very large N (e.g., N=50) would show limiting behavior but individual roots become indistinguishable. Very small N (N=1, 2) are degenerate cases.\n\n### 6. Computational Insights Valuable for a Paper\n\n**Implementation Insights:**\n\n1. **Numerical Stability**: The code uses direct polynomial construction (`np.poly`) rather than symbolic manipulation. For publication-quality figures, verify numerical accuracy for larger N (floating-point errors accumulate).\n\n2. **Coefficient Scaling Pattern**: The code explicitly scales by 2^(N-1) to match Chebyshev's leading coefficient. This is essential—without it, polynomials would differ by more than a constant.\n\n3. **Constant Term Behavior**: Line 144 displays `scaled_coeffs[-1]`, showing it varies as c(φ). This could be plotted separately to show its functional form (likely trigonometric in φ).\n\n**Visual Design Choices:**\n\n- **Aspect ratio**: 900×1500 (3:5) provides vertical space for polynomial oscillations\n- **Coordinate ranges**: x ∈ [-1.5, 1.5], y ∈ [-2.5, 2.5] chosen to contain Chebyshev extrema (±2^(N-1) for small N)\n- **Color coding**: Red (roots on circle) → pink (projections) → blue (polynomial) creates clear visual flow\n- **300 frames**: Provides smooth animation at 30ms/frame ≈ 9 second loop\n\n**Recommended Figures for Paper:**\n\n1. **Static snapshots** at key rotation angles (φ = 0, π/6, π/4, π/3, π/2) for N=5, showing:\n   - Root positions on circle\n   - Projections on real axis\n   - Resulting polynomial overlay\n   - Chebyshev T_5(x) in different color for comparison\n\n2. **Superposition plot**: Overlay polynomial curves for multiple φ values (semi-transparent), showing they coincide except for vertical shift\n\n3. **Constant term plot**: Graph c(φ) vs φ for 0 ≤ φ ≤ 2π, showing periodic behavior\n\n4. **Multi-N comparison**: Grid of subplots showing N=3,4,5,6 at same φ value, illustrating degree progression\n\n5. **Extrema locations**: Annotated plot showing Chebyshev polynomial extrema align with expected cos(πk/N) positions\n\n**Potential Extensions** (not in current code):\n\n- Plot constant term c(φ) as function of φ\n- Overlay actual Chebyshev polynomial T_N(x) for direct comparison\n- Show coefficient values (not just constant term) as φ varies\n- 3D visualization: (x, φ, P(x;φ)) surface showing invariance along φ-direction except constant shift\n\n**Computational Verification Note**: The animations empirically validate the theorem for specific N values. Combined with formal Lean proof, this provides both rigorous verification and intuitive understanding—ideal for a paper targeting mathematicians who value both rigor and geometric insight.\n\n---\n\nThe visualization code is well-designed for its purpose: providing geometric intuition for an otherwise abstract algebraic result. For a paper, you'd want to extract static frames with careful annotations, plus potentially the constant-term-vs-angle plot which isn't currently generated but would be straightforward to add."}]}]},"uuid":"3be6439a-c52e-4017-a4d4-b3ddcd7d508c","timestamp":"2025-11-12T04:38:05.115Z","toolUseResult":{"status":"completed","prompt":"Explore the Python visualization code (main.py and any supporting files).\n\nExtract:\n1.

This is correct.\n\n**Polynomial Evaluation (lines 41-46):**\nUses Horner's method for efficient evaluation:\n```\nP(x) = ((...((c_0·x + c_1)·x + c_2)·x + ...) + c_n\n```\n\n### 3. How Animations Demonstrate the Theorem\n\nThe animations provide **dynamic proof-of-concept** by showing:\n\n1. **Continuous rotation**: The red points on the unit circle rotate smoothly through a full 360° cycle\n2. **Projection mapping**: Pink/red projection lines show how each root maps to the real axis\n3. **Polynomial stability**: The blue polynomial curve maintains its characteristic oscillating shape (the Chebyshev form)\n4. **Constant term variation**: Text overlay shows the constant term changing continuously while the curve shape stays fixed\n5. **Full cycle closure**: After 360° rotation, the configuration returns to initial state, demonstrating periodicity\n\n**Key visual insight**: Despite roots moving continuously, the polynomial's shape is invariant—only vertical translation occurs.\n\n### 4. Geometric Intuition Provided\n\nThe visualizations reveal several deep geometric insights:\n\n**A. Discrete Rotational Symmetry**\n- N-fold rotational symmetry of the roots means rotation by 2π/N produces an equivalent configuration (permuted roots)\n- This discrete symmetry underlies why coefficients (symmetric functions of roots) have limited freedom\n\n**B. Projection Geometry**\n- The unit circle compresses to the interval [-1, 1] under real projection\n- Rotated roots sweep out different configurations on [-1, 1], but these configurations are \"equivalent\" in a polynomial sense\n\n**C. Chebyshev Oscillation Pattern**\n- For N roots, the polynomial has N-1 extrema in [-1, 1]\n- The characteristic \"equiripple\" behavior of Chebyshev polynomials is visible: equally-spaced oscillations between ±2^(N-1)\n\n**D. Fourier/Harmonic Connection**\n- Equally-spaced points on a circle encode discrete Fourier structure\n- The invariance of polynomial shape under rotation is geometric manifestation of discrete orthogonality relations\n\n### 5. Choice of N Values and Rationale\n\n**N ∈ {3, 4, 5, 6, 12, 13}** (line 156)\n\nRationale by category:\n\n**Small N (3, 4, 5, 6):**\n- **Pedagogical clarity**: Easy to visually track individual roots\n- **Low-degree polynomials**: Curves are simple, extrema are countable\n- **Distinct behaviors**:\n  - N=3: Cubic with characteristic \"S\" shape\n  - N=4: Quartic with 3 turning points\n  - N=5: Quintic (featured in README as primary example)\n  - N=6: Sextic showing increased oscillation\n\n**Medium N (12):**\n- **Pattern emergence**: High enough to see the oscillatory pattern clearly\n- **Still visualizable**: Not so many roots that they blur together\n- **Divisibility**: 12 = 2² × 3 has many divisors, showing how different angular spacings work\n\n**Prime N (13):**\n- **No sub-symmetries**: Prime N means no proper divisors, so no finer rotational sub-symmetry\n- **Demonstrates generality**: Shows theorem isn't restricted to composite N\n- **Maximum \"generic\" behavior**: Least structured case\n\n**Omitted values**: Very large N (e.g., N=50) would show limiting behavior but individual roots become indistinguishable. Very small N (N=1, 2) are degenerate cases.\n\n### 6. Computational Insights Valuable for a Paper\n\n**Implementation Insights:**\n\n1. **Numerical Stability**: The code uses direct polynomial construction (`np.poly`) rather than symbolic manipulation. For publication-quality figures, verify numerical accuracy for larger N (floating-point errors accumulate).\n\n2. **Coefficient Scaling Pattern**: The code explicitly scales by 2^(N-1) to match Chebyshev's leading coefficient. This is essential—without it, polynomials would differ by more than a constant.\n\n3. **Constant Term Behavior**: Line 144 displays `scaled_coeffs[-1]`, showing it varies as c(φ). This could be plotted separately to show its functional form (likely trigonometric in φ).\n\n**Visual Design Choices:**\n\n- **Aspect ratio**: 900×1500 (3:5) provides vertical space for polynomial oscillations\n- **Coordinate ranges**: x ∈ [-1.5, 1.5], y ∈ [-2.5, 2.5] chosen to contain Chebyshev extrema (±2^(N-1) for small N)\n- **Color coding**: Red (roots on circle) → pink (projections) → blue (polynomial) creates clear visual flow\n- **300 frames**: Provides smooth animation at 30ms/frame ≈ 9 second loop\n\n**Recommended Figures for Paper:**\n\n1. **Static snapshots** at key rotation angles (φ = 0, π/6, π/4, π/3, π/2) for N=5, showing:\n   - Root positions on circle\n   - Projections on real axis\n   - Resulting polynomial overlay\n   - Chebyshev T_5(x) in different color for comparison\n\n2. **Superposition plot**: Overlay polynomial curves for multiple φ values (semi-transparent), showing they coincide except for vertical shift\n\n3. **Constant term plot**: Graph c(φ) vs φ for 0 ≤ φ ≤ 2π, showing periodic behavior\n\n4. **Multi-N comparison**: Grid of subplots showing N=3,4,5,6 at same φ value, illustrating degree progression\n\n5. **Extrema locations**: Annotated plot showing Chebyshev polynomial extrema align with expected cos(πk/N) positions\n\n**Potential Extensions** (not in current code):\n\n- Plot constant term c(φ) as function of φ\n- Overlay actual Chebyshev polynomial T_N(x) for direct comparison\n- Show coefficient values (not just constant term) as φ varies\n- 3D visualization: (x, φ, P(x;φ)) surface showing invariance along φ-direction except constant shift\n\n**Computational Verification Note**: The animations empirically validate the theorem for specific N values. Combined with formal Lean proof, this provides both rigorous verification and intuitive understanding—ideal for a paper targeting mathematicians who value both rigor and geometric insight.\n\n---\n\nThe visualization code is well-designed for its purpose: providing geometric intuition for an otherwise abstract algebraic result. For a paper, you'd want to extract static frames with careful annotations, plus potentially the constant-term-vs-angle plot which isn't currently generated but would be straightforward to add."}],"totalDurationMs":68966,"totalTokens":24404,"totalToolUseCount":6,"usage":{"input_tokens":5,"cache_creation_input_tokens":200,"cache_read_input_tokens":22002,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":200,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":2197,"service_tier":"standard"}}}

Let me compile a comprehensive analysis.\n\n## Complete Mathematical Analysis of Foundational Modules\n\n### 1. **RootsOfUnity.lean** - Rotated Roots and Real Projections\n\n#### Definitions\n\n**rotatedRootsOfUnity (N : ℕ) (φ : ℝ)**: The N-th primitive roots of unity rotated by angle φ. Each primitive N-th root ω is multiplied by exp(iφ), yielding elements of the form exp(i(φ + 2πk/N)).\n\n**realProjections (N : ℕ) (φ : ℝ)**: The real parts of rotated roots of unity. These are the values that will become roots of the constructed polynomial.\n\n**realProjectionsList (N : ℕ) (φ : ℝ)**: An ordered list representation: [cos(φ + 2πk/N) : k ∈ [0, N)]\n\n#### Main Theorems\n\n**realProjection_eq_cos**: The real projection of the k-th rotated root equals cos(φ + 2πk/N). This establishes the explicit trigonometric form of the projections.\n\n**realProjection_mem_Icc**: All real projections lie in [-1, 1], following from the range of cosine.\n\n**card_realProjectionsList**: The list has exactly N elements.\n\n**realProjectionsList_sum**: The sum of real projections equals the Finset sum ∑_{k=0}^{N-1} cos(φ + 2πk/N).\n\n**realProjectionsList_powersum**: The j-th power sum equals ∑_{k=0}^{N-1} cos(φ + 2πk/N)^j.\n\n#### Mathematical Content\n\nThis module establishes the geometric foundation: we take the N equally-spaced points on the unit circle (primitive N-th roots of unity), rotate the entire configuration by angle φ, and project onto the real axis. This yields N real numbers in [-1, 1] that will serve as roots of a polynomial. The key insight is that these projections have a simple trigonometric form, enabling the use of trigonometric identities to analyze the resulting polynomial.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **PolynomialConstruction.lean** - Building Polynomials from Roots\n\n#### Definitions\n\n**polynomialFromRealRoots (roots : List ℝ)**: Constructs the monic polynomial (X - r₁)(X - r₂)⋯(X - rₙ) from a list of roots.\n\n**unscaledPolynomial (N : ℕ) (φ : ℝ)**: The monic polynomial with roots at cos(φ + 2πk/N) for k = 0, ..., N-1. This is the natural polynomial arising from the real projections.\n\n**scaledPolynomial (N : ℕ) (φ : ℝ)**: The product 2^(N-1) × unscaledPolynomial. This scaling adjusts the leading coefficient to match Chebyshev polynomial normalization.\n\n**scaledPolynomial_coeff (N : ℕ) (φ : ℝ) (k : ℕ)**: Extracts the coefficient of X^k from the scaled polynomial.\n\n#### Main Theorems\n\n**polynomialFromRealRoots_eval_mem**: If r is in the root list, then the polynomial evaluates to zero at r.\n\n**polynomialFromRealRoots_degree**: The degree equals the list length.\n\n**unscaledPolynomial_degree**: Degree equals N.\n\n**scaledPolynomial_degree**: Degree equals N (for N > 0).\n\n**unscaledPolynomial_monic**: Leading coefficient is 1.\n\n**scaledPolynomial_leadingCoeff**: Leading coefficient is 2^(N-1).\n\n**scaledPolynomial_constantTerm_varies**: The constant term (coefficient of X^0) depends on φ. This is proven by case analysis for small N and general arguments for N ≥ 7.\n\n#### Mathematical Content\n\nThis module constructs the central polynomial object. Given the N real projections, we form the monic polynomial having these as roots, then scale by 2^(N-1). The crucial result is that the constant term varies with φ while (as will be shown using Newton's identities) higher-degree coefficients do not. This non-trivial variation establishes that the polynomial genuinely depends on φ in a controlled way.\n\nThe proof that the constant term varies uses explicit angle choices (typically φ = 0 vs φ = π/2) and number-theoretic arguments showing that cos(2πk/N) ≠ 0 for certain k values when N is odd and sufficiently large.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **TrigonometricIdentities.lean** - Vanishing Sums\n\n#### Main Theorems\n\n**sum_cos_roots_of_unity**: For N ≥ 2, ∑_{k=0}^{N-1} cos(φ + 2πk/N) = 0.\n\n**sum_cos_multiple_rotated_roots**: For 0 < m < N, ∑_{k=0}^{N-1} cos(m(φ + 2πk/N)) = 0.\n\n**cos_cube_formula**: Power reduction formula cos³(x) = (cos(3x) + 3cos(x))/4.\n\n**list_foldr_eq_multiset_prod**: Technical lemma relating list-based polynomial construction to multiset products.\n\n#### Mathematical Content\n\nThe key results here exploit the structure of roots of unity. The sum ∑_{k=0}^{N-1} exp(i(φ + 2πk/N)) = exp(iφ) ∑_{k=0}^{N-1} exp(2πik/N) = 0 because the N-th roots of unity sum to zero (they're vertices of a regular N-gon centered at origin). Taking real parts gives the cosine sum identity.\n\nFor multiples: ∑_{k=0}^{N-1} cos(m(φ + 2πk/N)) = Re(exp(imφ) ∑_{k=0}^{N-1} exp(2πimk/N)). Since 0 < m < N, the complex numbers exp(2πim/N) form the vertices of a regular N-gon (rotated by angle 2πm/N from the standard roots), so their sum is zero.\n\nThese vanishing sums are **fundamental** - they ensure that when we express power sums ∑ cos^j using power-reduction formulas, all non-constant trigonometric terms disappear, leaving only φ-independent contributions.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **ChebyshevRoots.lean** - Characterizing Chebyshev Roots\n\n#### Definitions\n\n**chebyshevRoot (N k : ℕ)**: The k-th root of T_N, defined as cos((2k+1)π/(2N)).\n\n**chebyshevRootsList (N : ℕ)**: List of all N Chebyshev roots.\n\n#### Main Theorems\n\n**chebyshevRoot_in_Icc**: All Chebyshev roots lie in [-1, 1].\n\n**chebyshev_T_eval_chebyshevRoot**: T_N(cos((2k+1)π/(2N))) = 0. Proof uses the fundamental identity T_N(cos θ) = cos(Nθ) and the fact that cos((2k+1)π/2) = 0.\n\n**chebyshevRoots_distinct**: The N Chebyshev roots are pairwise distinct. Proof uses injectivity of cosine on [0, π] and the fact that the angles (2k+1)π/(2N) are strictly ordered in [0, π].\n\n**chebyshev_T_eval_eq_zero_forward**: If T_N(x) = 0, then x is one of the N Chebyshev roots. Proof by contradiction: if x were an additional root, T_N would have N+1 roots, contradicting its degree N.\n\n**chebyshev_T_eval_eq_zero_iff**: Complete characterization - T_N(x) = 0 iff x = cos((2k+1)π/(2N)) for some k < N.\n\n#### Mathematical Content\n\nThis module establishes the **exact root set** of Chebyshev polynomials T_N. The roots are located at the cosines of equally-spaced \"odd multiples of π/(2N)\" angles. These are precisely the projections onto the real axis of N equally-spaced points on the unit circle, offset by π/(2N) from the standard roots of unity.\n\nThe completeness of the characterization (forward and backward directions) is essential for the main theorem. It shows that:\n1. Chebyshev polynomials have degree exactly N with N distinct real roots in [-1, 1]\n2. The roots have the explicit trigonometric form given\n3. No other values in ℝ are roots\n\nThis sets up the connection to the rotated roots of unity: when φ = π/(2N), the real projections cos(π/(2N) + 2πk/N) = cos((2k+1)π/(2N)) are exactly the Chebyshev roots.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **PowerSums.lean** - φ-Invariance of Power Sums\n\n#### Main Theorems\n\n**powerSumCos_invariant_j2 through powerSumCos_invariant_j6**: Explicit proofs for small powers using power-reduction formulas. Each reduces cos^j to a linear combination of cos(mx) for various m, then applies the vanishing sum identities.\n\n**powerSumCos_invariant**: **General theorem** - For 0 < j < N, ∑_{k=0}^{N-1} cos(θ₁ + 2πk/N)^j = ∑_{k=0}^{N-1} cos(θ₂ + 2πk/N)^j.\n\n**sum_cos_pow_eq_sum_binomial**: Expresses ∑ cos^j as a sum over binomial expansion with vanishing non-constant terms.\n\n**sum_cos_int_multiple_vanishes**: Generalizes the vanishing sum to integer multiples (including negative).\n\n#### Mathematical Content\n\nThis is the **heart of the φ-invariance proof**. The strategy:\n\n1. **Power-reduction formulas**: Express cos^j(x) as a linear combination of cos(mx) for m = 0, j, 2j, 3j, ... (derived using cos(x) = (e^{ix} + e^{-ix})/2 and binomial expansion).\n\n2. **Binomial expansion approach**: cos^j(x) = (e^{ix} + e^{-ix})^j / 2^j = (1/2^j) ∑_{r=0}^j (j choose r) e^{i(2r-j)x}. Taking real parts gives cos^j(x) as a linear combination of cos((2r-j)x).\n\n3. **Summation over roots**: ∑_{k=0}^{N-1} cos((2r-j)(θ + 2πk/N))\n   - If 2r - j = 0, this sum equals N (constant term, φ-independent)\n   - If 2r - j ≠ 0 and |2r - j| < N (which holds since r ≤ j < N), the sum vanishes by the multiple-root identity\n\n4. **Conclusion**: All θ-dependent terms vanish, leaving only constant contributions. Therefore the power sum is independent of θ.\n\nThis is a beautiful application of the **geometric structure of roots of unity** combined with **harmonic analysis** (Fourier-type decomposition of powers of cosine).\n\n---\n\n### 6. **NewtonIdentities.lean** - From Power Sums to Coefficients\n\n#### Main Theorems\n\n**multiset_newton_identity**: For a multiset s and m > 0,\n   m · e_m = (-1)^{m+1} ∑_{i+j=m, i<m} (-1)^i · e_i · p_j\nwhere e_k is the k-th elementary symmetric function and p_j is the j-th power sum.\n\n**esymm_eq_of_psum_eq**: If two multisets have equal cardinality and equal power sums (for all 0 < j < card), then they have equal elementary symmetric functions.\n\n**esymm_rotated_roots_invariant**: The elementary symmetric polynomials in the rotated roots cos(φ + 2πk/N) are φ-invariant for 0 < m < N.\n\n**polynomial_coeff_eq_of_esymm_eq**: Equal elementary symmetric functions imply equal polynomial coefficients (via Vieta's formulas).\n\n#### Mathematical Content\n\nThis module provides the **algebraic bridge** from power-sum invariance to coefficient invariance.\n\n**Newton's identities** express elementary symmetric functions recursively in terms of power sums:\n- e_1 = p_1\n- 2e_2 = e_1·p_1 - p_2\n- 3e_3 = e_2·p_1 - e_1·p_2 + p_3\n- etc.\n\nBy strong induction:\n1. **Base case**: e_1 = p_1/1, and p_1 = ∑ cos(φ + 2πk/N) = 0 for N ≥ 2 (by the vanishing sum)\n2. **Inductive step**: For m > 1, Newton's identity expresses m·e_m in terms of {e_i : i < m} and {p_j : j ≤ m}. By IH, the e_i with i < m are φ-invariant. By powerSumCos_invariant, the p_j with 0 < j < N are φ-invariant. Therefore e_m is φ-invariant.\n\n**Vieta's formulas** then connect elementary symmetric functions to polynomial coefficients:\n- For a polynomial (X - r_1)⋯(X - r_N) = ∑_{k=0}^N c_k X^k,\n- c_k = (-1)^{N-k} · e_{N-k}\n\nSince the e_m are φ-invariant for 0 < m < N, the coefficients c_k are φ-invariant for 0 < k ≤ N. Combined with the explicit leading coefficient (2^{N-1}) and the varying constant term, this pins down the polynomial uniquely.\n\n---\n\n### 7. **PolynomialProperties.lean** - Tying It All Together\n\n#### Main Theorems\n\n**constant_term_only_varies**: For k > 0, the k-th coefficient of scaledPolynomial is φ-invariant.\n\n**chebyshev_T_degree**: T_N has degree exactly N (for N ≥ 1). Proven by induction using the recurrence T_{n+2} = 2X·T_{n+1} - T_n.\n\n**scaledPolynomial_degree_eq_chebyshev**: The scaled polynomial has the same degree as T_N.\n\n**chebyshev_eval_cos**: T_N(cos φ) = cos(Nφ) (fundamental Chebyshev identity).\n\n#### Mathematical Content\n\nThis module consolidates the results:\n\n1. **Coefficient structure**: By applying esymm_rotated_roots_invariant and the Newton identities machinery, all non-constant coefficients are φ-invariant.\n\n2. **Degree matching**: Both polynomials have degree N with leading coefficient 2^{N-1}.\n\n3. **Root matching** (proven elsewhere): When φ = π/(2N), the roots of scaledPolynomial are exactly the Chebyshev roots.\n\nTogether with the uniqueness argument (two monic polynomials of degree N with the same roots are equal, hence two polynomials with the same roots and leading coefficient differ by at most the constant term), this sets up the final theorem.\n\n---\n\n## How These Build the Foundation for the Main Theorem\n\nThe complete logical flow:\n\n1. **RootsOfUnity**: Defines the rotated roots cos(φ + 2πk/N) and their basic properties.\n\n2. **PolynomialConstruction**: Builds the polynomial P_φ(X) = 2^{N-1} ∏_{k=0}^{N-1} (X - cos(φ + 2πk/N)).\n\n3. **TrigonometricIdentities**: Proves ∑ cos(m(φ + 2πk/N)) = 0 for 0 < m < N, the key vanishing property.\n\n4. **PowerSums**: Uses binomial expansion + vanishing sums to prove power sums are φ-invariant.\n\n5. **NewtonIdentities**: Uses Newton's identities to convert power-sum invariance into elementary-symmetric-function invariance.\n\n6. **PolynomialProperties**: Uses Vieta's formulas to convert esymm invariance into coefficient invariance (except constant term).\n\n7. **ChebyshevRoots**: Characterizes the roots of T_N exactly.\n\n**Main Theorem Completion**: \n- At φ = π/(2N), the roots of P_φ are the Chebyshev roots\n- P_φ and T_N have the same degree and leading coefficient\n- P_φ and T_N differ by a φ-dependent constant C(φ)\n- Therefore P_φ(X) = T_N(X) + C(φ)\n- Evaluating at a specific point determines C(φ)\n- This gives the explicit formula for the constant in terms of φ\n\n---\n\n## Non-Standard Techniques\n\n1. **Geometric approach to polynomial roots**: Using rotated roots of unity projected onto the real axis is not the standard way Chebyshev polynomials are defined. This provides a beautiful geometric interpretation.\n\n2. **Power-sum invariance via complex exponentials**: The use of binomial expansion on (e^{ix} + e^{-ix})^j and summing over roots of unity is elegant harmonic analysis.\n\n3. **Newton's identities for multisets**: The formalization explicitly handles Newton's identities at the multiset level, carefully managing the relationship between finset sums, list operations, and multiset operations.\n\n4. **Case-by-case constant term variation**: The proof that the constant term varies uses explicit numerical verification for small N and parity-based arguments for large N, a computational approach that's rigorous but unusual in classical texts.\n\n5. **Strong induction on both j and m**: The proofs use nested strong induction to establish invariance properties, carefully managing the dependencies between power sums, elementary symmetric functions, and polynomial coefficients."}]}]},"uuid":"8f41d5eb-8e0f-47a2-80ef-196567596cf8","timestamp":"2025-11-12T04:38:45.670Z","toolUseResult":{"status":"completed","prompt":"Perform a very thorough exploration of the foundational modules:\n- ChebyshevCircles/RootsOfUnity.lean\n- ChebyshevCircles/PolynomialConstruction.lean  \n- ChebyshevCircles/TrigonometricIdentities.lean\n- ChebyshevCircles/ChebyshevRoots.lean\n\nFor each module, extract:\n1.

This non-trivial variation establishes that the polynomial genuinely depends on φ in a controlled way.\n\nThe proof that the constant term varies uses explicit angle choices (typically φ = 0 vs φ = π/2) and number-theoretic arguments showing that cos(2πk/N) ≠ 0 for certain k values when N is odd and sufficiently large.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **TrigonometricIdentities.lean** - Vanishing Sums\n\n#### Main Theorems\n\n**sum_cos_roots_of_unity**: For N ≥ 2, ∑_{k=0}^{N-1} cos(φ + 2πk/N) = 0.\n\n**sum_cos_multiple_rotated_roots**: For 0 < m < N, ∑_{k=0}^{N-1} cos(m(φ + 2πk/N)) = 0.\n\n**cos_cube_formula**: Power reduction formula cos³(x) = (cos(3x) + 3cos(x))/4.\n\n**list_foldr_eq_multiset_prod**: Technical lemma relating list-based polynomial construction to multiset products.\n\n#### Mathematical Content\n\nThe key results here exploit the structure of roots of unity. The sum ∑_{k=0}^{N-1} exp(i(φ + 2πk/N)) = exp(iφ) ∑_{k=0}^{N-1} exp(2πik/N) = 0 because the N-th roots of unity sum to zero (they're vertices of a regular N-gon centered at origin). Taking real parts gives the cosine sum identity.\n\nFor multiples: ∑_{k=0}^{N-1} cos(m(φ + 2πk/N)) = Re(exp(imφ) ∑_{k=0}^{N-1} exp(2πimk/N)). Since 0 < m < N, the complex numbers exp(2πim/N) form the vertices of a regular N-gon (rotated by angle 2πm/N from the standard roots), so their sum is zero.\n\nThese vanishing sums are **fundamental** - they ensure that when we express power sums ∑ cos^j using power-reduction formulas, all non-constant trigonometric terms disappear, leaving only φ-independent contributions.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **ChebyshevRoots.lean** - Characterizing Chebyshev Roots\n\n#### Definitions\n\n**chebyshevRoot (N k : ℕ)**: The k-th root of T_N, defined as cos((2k+1)π/(2N)).\n\n**chebyshevRootsList (N : ℕ)**: List of all N Chebyshev roots.\n\n#### Main Theorems\n\n**chebyshevRoot_in_Icc**: All Chebyshev roots lie in [-1, 1].\n\n**chebyshev_T_eval_chebyshevRoot**: T_N(cos((2k+1)π/(2N))) = 0. Proof uses the fundamental identity T_N(cos θ) = cos(Nθ) and the fact that cos((2k+1)π/2) = 0.\n\n**chebyshevRoots_distinct**: The N Chebyshev roots are pairwise distinct. Proof uses injectivity of cosine on [0, π] and the fact that the angles (2k+1)π/(2N) are strictly ordered in [0, π].\n\n**chebyshev_T_eval_eq_zero_forward**: If T_N(x) = 0, then x is one of the N Chebyshev roots. Proof by contradiction: if x were an additional root, T_N would have N+1 roots, contradicting its degree N.\n\n**chebyshev_T_eval_eq_zero_iff**: Complete characterization - T_N(x) = 0 iff x = cos((2k+1)π/(2N)) for some k < N.\n\n#### Mathematical Content\n\nThis module establishes the **exact root set** of Chebyshev polynomials T_N. The roots are located at the cosines of equally-spaced \"odd multiples of π/(2N)\" angles. These are precisely the projections onto the real axis of N equally-spaced points on the unit circle, offset by π/(2N) from the standard roots of unity.\n\nThe completeness of the characterization (forward and backward directions) is essential for the main theorem. It shows that:\n1. Chebyshev polynomials have degree exactly N with N distinct real roots in [-1, 1]\n2. The roots have the explicit trigonometric form given\n3. No other values in ℝ are roots\n\nThis sets up the connection to the rotated roots of unity: when φ = π/(2N), the real projections cos(π/(2N) + 2πk/N) = cos((2k+1)π/(2N)) are exactly the Chebyshev roots.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **PowerSums.lean** - φ-Invariance of Power Sums\n\n#### Main Theorems\n\n**powerSumCos_invariant_j2 through powerSumCos_invariant_j6**: Explicit proofs for small powers using power-reduction formulas. Each reduces cos^j to a linear combination of cos(mx) for various m, then applies the vanishing sum identities.\n\n**powerSumCos_invariant**: **General theorem** - For 0 < j < N, ∑_{k=0}^{N-1} cos(θ₁ + 2πk/N)^j = ∑_{k=0}^{N-1} cos(θ₂ + 2πk/N)^j.\n\n**sum_cos_pow_eq_sum_binomial**: Expresses ∑ cos^j as a sum over binomial expansion with vanishing non-constant terms.\n\n**sum_cos_int_multiple_vanishes**: Generalizes the vanishing sum to integer multiples (including negative).\n\n#### Mathematical Content\n\nThis is the **heart of the φ-invariance proof**. The strategy:\n\n1. **Power-reduction formulas**: Express cos^j(x) as a linear combination of cos(mx) for m = 0, j, 2j, 3j, ... (derived using cos(x) = (e^{ix} + e^{-ix})/2 and binomial expansion).\n\n2. **Binomial expansion approach**: cos^j(x) = (e^{ix} + e^{-ix})^j / 2^j = (1/2^j) ∑_{r=0}^j (j choose r) e^{i(2r-j)x}. Taking real parts gives cos^j(x) as a linear combination of cos((2r-j)x).\n\n3. **Summation over roots**: ∑_{k=0}^{N-1} cos((2r-j)(θ + 2πk/N))\n   - If 2r - j = 0, this sum equals N (constant term, φ-independent)\n   - If 2r - j ≠ 0 and |2r - j| < N (which holds since r ≤ j < N), the sum vanishes by the multiple-root identity\n\n4. **Conclusion**: All θ-dependent terms vanish, leaving only constant contributions. Therefore the power sum is independent of θ.\n\nThis is a beautiful application of the **geometric structure of roots of unity** combined with **harmonic analysis** (Fourier-type decomposition of powers of cosine).\n\n---\n\n### 6. **NewtonIdentities.lean** - From Power Sums to Coefficients\n\n#### Main Theorems\n\n**multiset_newton_identity**: For a multiset s and m > 0,\n   m · e_m = (-1)^{m+1} ∑_{i+j=m, i<m} (-1)^i · e_i · p_j\nwhere e_k is the k-th elementary symmetric function and p_j is the j-th power sum.\n\n**esymm_eq_of_psum_eq**: If two multisets have equal cardinality and equal power sums (for all 0 < j < card), then they have equal elementary symmetric functions.\n\n**esymm_rotated_roots_invariant**: The elementary symmetric polynomials in the rotated roots cos(φ + 2πk/N) are φ-invariant for 0 < m < N.\n\n**polynomial_coeff_eq_of_esymm_eq**: Equal elementary symmetric functions imply equal polynomial coefficients (via Vieta's formulas).\n\n#### Mathematical Content\n\nThis module provides the **algebraic bridge** from power-sum invariance to coefficient invariance.\n\n**Newton's identities** express elementary symmetric functions recursively in terms of power sums:\n- e_1 = p_1\n- 2e_2 = e_1·p_1 - p_2\n- 3e_3 = e_2·p_1 - e_1·p_2 + p_3\n- etc.\n\nBy strong induction:\n1. **Base case**: e_1 = p_1/1, and p_1 = ∑ cos(φ + 2πk/N) = 0 for N ≥ 2 (by the vanishing sum)\n2. **Inductive step**: For m > 1, Newton's identity expresses m·e_m in terms of {e_i : i < m} and {p_j : j ≤ m}. By IH, the e_i with i < m are φ-invariant. By powerSumCos_invariant, the p_j with 0 < j < N are φ-invariant. Therefore e_m is φ-invariant.\n\n**Vieta's formulas** then connect elementary symmetric functions to polynomial coefficients:\n- For a polynomial (X - r_1)⋯(X - r_N) = ∑_{k=0}^N c_k X^k,\n- c_k = (-1)^{N-k} · e_{N-k}\n\nSince the e_m are φ-invariant for 0 < m < N, the coefficients c_k are φ-invariant for 0 < k ≤ N. Combined with the explicit leading coefficient (2^{N-1}) and the varying constant term, this pins down the polynomial uniquely.\n\n---\n\n### 7. **PolynomialProperties.lean** - Tying It All Together\n\n#### Main Theorems\n\n**constant_term_only_varies**: For k > 0, the k-th coefficient of scaledPolynomial is φ-invariant.\n\n**chebyshev_T_degree**: T_N has degree exactly N (for N ≥ 1).

Root Definitions\n\n**Rotated Roots (RootsOfUnity.lean):**\n```\nr_k(φ) = cos(φ + 2πk/N),  k = 0, 1, ..., N-1\n```\nThese are real projections of e^(i(φ + 2πk/N)) onto the real axis.\n\n**Chebyshev Roots (ChebyshevRoots.lean):**\n```\nρ_k = cos((2k+1)π/(2N)),  k = 0, 1, ..., N-1\n```\nThese are the exact roots of T_N(x) = 0.\n\n**Key Property:** Both root sets lie in [-1, 1] and consist of N distinct values (for N > 0).\n\n### 2.

Since cos is strictly decreasing on [0, π], the cosines are distinct.\n\n**Lemma (chebyshev_T_eval_eq_zero_iff):** \n```\nT_N(x) = 0  ⟺  ∃k ∈ {0,...,N-1}, x = ρ_k\n```\n\n**Proof:** T_N has degree N and has N distinct roots {ρ_0, ..., ρ_{N-1}}. By fundamental theorem of algebra, these are ALL the roots.\n\n### STEP 2: Discrete Orthogonality (TrigonometricIdentities.lean, ChebyshevOrthogonality.lean)\n\n**Core Orthogonality Relation:**\n\nFor primitive N-th roots of unity ω = e^(2πi/N):\n```\n∑_{k=0}^{N-1} ω^{km} = { N  if N | m\n                        { 0  otherwise\n```\n\n**Trigonometric Form (sum_cos_roots_of_unity):**\n```\n∑_{k=0}^{N-1} cos(φ + 2πk/N) = 0  for N ≥ 2\n```\n\n**Proof:** Write cos(x) = Re(e^{ix}).

By Newton's identities, they have the same elementary symmetric functions\n3.

This follows from injectivity of cos on appropriate intervals.\n\n3. **Index Arithmetic Modulo N:** Discrete orthogonality sums require careful handling of indices modulo N, especially for Chebyshev roots where pairing uses k ↦ N-1-k.\n\n4. **Degree Tracking:** Newton's identities apply only when relating e_m to p_1, ..., p_m. Must verify 0 < j < N to ensure power sums determine all coefficients except constant term.\n\n5. **Special Cases N ∈ {1,2,3}:** For small N, direct computation is more feasible than general machinery.

Root Definitions\n\n**Rotated Roots (RootsOfUnity.lean):**\n```\nr_k(φ) = cos(φ + 2πk/N),  k = 0, 1, ..., N-1\n```\nThese are real projections of e^(i(φ + 2πk/N)) onto the real axis.\n\n**Chebyshev Roots (ChebyshevRoots.lean):**\n```\nρ_k = cos((2k+1)π/(2N)),  k = 0, 1, ..., N-1\n```\nThese are the exact roots of T_N(x) = 0.\n\n**Key Property:** Both root sets lie in [-1, 1] and consist of N distinct values (for N > 0).\n\n### 2. Polynomial Constructions\n\n**Unscaled Polynomial:**\n```\nP_N(φ, x) = ∏_{k=0}^{N-1} (x - r_k(φ))\n```\nThis is monic (leading coefficient = 1) with degree N.\n\n**Scaled Polynomial:**\n```\nS_N(φ, x) = 2^(N-1) · P_N(φ, x)\n```\nThis adjusts the leading coefficient to match Chebyshev normalization.\n\n**Chebyshev Polynomial T_N:**\n- T_0(x) = 1\n- T_1(x) = x  \n- T_{n+1}(x) = 2x·T_n(x) - T_{n-1}(x)\n- Equivalently: T_N(cos θ) = cos(Nθ)\n- Leading coefficient = 2^(N-1) for N ≥ 1\n\n---\n\n## Proof Architecture\n\nThe proof proceeds through 5 major components:\n\n### STEP 1: Root Characterization (ChebyshevRoots.lean)\n\n**Lemma (chebyshev_T_eval_chebyshevRoot):**\n```\nT_N(cos((2k+1)π/(2N))) = 0  for all k = 0, ..., N-1\n```\n\n**Proof sketch:** Use T_N(cos θ) = cos(Nθ). Then:\n```\nT_N(cos((2k+1)π/(2N))) = cos(N · (2k+1)π/(2N))\n                        = cos((2k+1)π/2)\n                        = 0\n```\nsince (2k+1)π/2 is an odd multiple of π/2.\n\n**Lemma (chebyshevRoots_distinct):** The roots ρ_0, ..., ρ_{N-1} are pairwise distinct.\n\n**Proof sketch:** The angles (2k+1)π/(2N) all lie in [0, π] and are strictly increasing. Since cos is strictly decreasing on [0, π], the cosines are distinct.\n\n**Lemma (chebyshev_T_eval_eq_zero_iff):** \n```\nT_N(x) = 0  ⟺  ∃k ∈ {0,...,N-1}, x = ρ_k\n```\n\n**Proof:** T_N has degree N and has N distinct roots {ρ_0, ..., ρ_{N-1}}. By fundamental theorem of algebra, these are ALL the roots.\n\n### STEP 2: Discrete Orthogonality (TrigonometricIdentities.lean, ChebyshevOrthogonality.lean)\n\n**Core Orthogonality Relation:**\n\nFor primitive N-th roots of unity ω = e^(2πi/N):\n```\n∑_{k=0}^{N-1} ω^{km} = { N  if N | m\n                        { 0  otherwise\n```\n\n**Trigonometric Form (sum_cos_roots_of_unity):**\n```\n∑_{k=0}^{N-1} cos(φ + 2πk/N) = 0  for N ≥ 2\n```\n\n**Proof:** Write cos(x) = Re(e^{ix}). Then:\n```\n∑_{k=0}^{N-1} cos(φ + 2πk/N) = Re(e^{iφ} ∑_{k=0}^{N-1} ω^k)\n                               = Re(e^{iφ} · 0)  [geometric sum for ω ≠ 1]\n                               = 0\n```\n\n**Higher Multiples (sum_cos_multiple_rotated_roots):**\n```\n∑_{k=0}^{N-1} cos(m(φ + 2πk/N)) = 0  for 0 < m < N\n```\n\n**Proof:** Same technique using ∑_{k=0}^{N-1} ω^{km} = 0 when 0 < m < N.\n\n**Chebyshev Orthogonality (sum_cos_chebyshev_angles_vanishes):**\n```\n∑_{k=0}^{N-1} cos(m · (2k+1)π/(2N)) = 0  for odd m with 0 < |m| < 2N\n```\n\n**Proof:** Uses the symmetry (2k+1)π/(2N) + (2(N-1-k)+1)π/(2N) = π. For odd m, cos(mπ) = -1, so cos(m·second_angle) = -cos(m·first_angle). Terms pair up and cancel via the involution k ↦ N-1-k.\n\n### STEP 3: Power Sum Invariance (PowerSums.lean)\n\n**Key Binomial Expansion (sum_cos_pow_eq_sum_binomial):**\n\nUsing cos(x) = (e^{ix} + e^{-ix})/2 and binomial theorem:\n```\n∑_{k=0}^{N-1} cos(θ + 2πk/N)^j = 2^{-j} · ∑_{r=0}^j C(j,r) · ∑_{k=0}^{N-1} cos((2r-j)(θ + 2πk/N))\n```\n\n**Analysis of Terms:**\n- When 2r - j ≠ 0: The inner sum vanishes by discrete orthogonality (assuming |2r-j| < N)\n- When 2r = j (middle term, requires j even): ∑ cos(0) = N\n\n**Conclusion:** For 0 < j < N:\n```\n∑_{k=0}^{N-1} cos(θ + 2πk/N)^j = { N · 2^{-j} · C(j, j/2)  if j even\n                                 { 0                        if j odd\n```\n\nThis value is **independent of θ**.\n\n**Main Invariance Theorem (sum_cos_pow_theta_independent):**\n```\n∑_{k=0}^{N-1} cos(θ₁ + 2πk/N)^j = ∑_{k=0}^{N-1} cos(θ₂ + 2πk/N)^j  for 0 < j < N\n```\n\n### STEP 4: Newton's Identities (NewtonIdentities.lean)\n\n**Newton's Identities relate power sums p_j = ∑ x_i^j to elementary symmetric functions e_m:**\n\nFor m > 0:\n```\nm · e_m = (-1)^{m+1} · ∑_{i=0}^{m-1} (-1)^i · e_i · p_{m-i}\n```\n\n**Key Consequence (esymm_eq_of_psum_eq):**\n\nIf two multisets s and t have:\n1. Same cardinality: |s| = |t|\n2. Same power sums: p_j(s) = p_j(t) for all 0 < j < |s|\n\nThen: e_m(s) = e_m(t) for all 0 ≤ m < |s|\n\n**Proof:** By induction on m using Newton's identity. The base case e_0 = 1 is trivial. For m > 0, Newton's identity expresses e_m in terms of e_0, ..., e_{m-1} and p_1, ..., p_m. By induction hypothesis, e_0, ..., e_{m-1} match, and by assumption p_1, ..., p_m match, hence e_m matches.\n\n**Application to Rotated Roots (esymm_rotated_roots_invariant):**\n\nSince power sums of rotated roots are φ-invariant (Step 3), Newton's identities imply:\n```\ne_m({r_0(φ₁), ..., r_{N-1}(φ₁)}) = e_m({r_0(φ₂), ..., r_{N-1}(φ₂)})  for 0 < m < N\n```\n\n### STEP 5: Coefficient Matching (PolynomialProperties.lean)\n\n**Vieta's Formulas connect elementary symmetric functions to polynomial coefficients:**\n\nFor polynomial ∏(x - r_i) = ∑ a_k x^k:\n```\na_k = (-1)^{N-k} · e_{N-k}({r_0, ..., r_{N-1}})\n```\n\n**Theorem (constant_term_only_varies):**\n```\nscaledPolynomial(N, φ₁).coeff(k) = scaledPolynomial(N, φ₂).coeff(k)  for all k > 0\n```\n\n**Proof:** \n1. Use Vieta: coeff(k) depends on e_{N-k}\n2. For k > 0, we have N - k < N\n3. By Step 4, e_{N-k} is φ-invariant\n4. Therefore coeff(k) is φ-invariant\n\n**Special Case: φ = 0**\n\nFor φ = 0, the rotated roots are cos(2πk/N), which are closely related to Chebyshev roots (different phase).\n\n**Theorem (scaledPolynomial_matches_chebyshev_at_zero):**\n```\nscaledPolynomial(N, 0).coeff(k) = T_N.coeff(k)  for all k > 0\n```\n\n**Proof Strategy:**\n- **Cases N = 1, 2, 3:** Direct computation by evaluating roots and polynomial coefficients\n- **Case N ≥ 4:** Use power sum equality\n\nFor N ≥ 4, the proof shows:\n1. Both {r_0(0), ..., r_{N-1}(0)} and {ρ_0, ..., ρ_{N-1}} have the same power sums for 0 < j < N (via general_powersum_equality in PowerSumEquality.lean)\n2. By Newton's identities, they have the same elementary symmetric functions\n3. Since both polynomials have the same degree N and leading coefficient 2^{N-1}, their coefficients match for k > 0\n\n### STEP 5.5: General Power Sum Equality (PowerSumEquality.lean)\n\n**Critical Lemma (general_powersum_equality):**\n\nFor 0 < j < N:\n```\n∑_{k=0}^{N-1} cos(2πk/N)^j = ∑_{k=0}^{N-1} cos((2k+1)π/(2N))^j\n```\n\n**Proof for rotated roots (φ=0):** Uses binomial expansion from Step 3.\n\n**Proof for Chebyshev roots:** Uses analogous binomial expansion combined with Chebyshev-specific orthogonality:\n```\n∑_{k=0}^{N-1} cos((2k+1)π/(2N))^j = 2^{-j} · ∑_{r=0}^j C(j,r) · ∑_{k=0}^{N-1} cos((2r-j)(2k+1)π/(2N))\n```\n\nThe inner sums vanish for 2r ≠ j by the Chebyshev orthogonality relation (Step 2).\n\n**Result:** Both power sums evaluate to the same closed form:\n```\n{ N · 2^{-j} · C(j, j/2)  if j even\n{ 0                        if j odd\n```\n\n---\n\n## FINAL ASSEMBLY (MainTheorem.lean, line 446)\n\n**Theorem (rotated_roots_yield_chebyshev):**\n```lean\ntheorem rotated_roots_yield_chebyshev (N : ℕ) (θ : ℝ) (hN : 0 < N) :\n    ∃ (c : ℝ), scaledPolynomial N θ = Polynomial.Chebyshev.T ℝ N + C c\n```\n\n**Proof:**\n1. Set c = scaledPolynomial(N, θ).coeff(0) - T_N.coeff(0)\n2. For k = 0: By definition of c, both sides have the same constant term\n3. For k > 0:\n   ```\n   scaledPolynomial(N, θ).coeff(k)\n     = scaledPolynomial(N, 0).coeff(k)          [by constant_term_only_varies]\n     = T_N.coeff(k)                             [by scaledPolynomial_matches_chebyshev_at_zero]\n     = (T_N + C c).coeff(k)                     [since C c contributes 0 to coeff k > 0]\n   ```\n4. Since all coefficients match, the polynomials are equal. ∎\n\n---\n\n## Supporting Theorems\n\n**Theorem (rotated_roots_coeffs_match_chebyshev):** Explicitly states:\n```\nscaledPolynomial(N, θ).coeff(k) = T_N.coeff(k)  for all k > 0\n```\n\n**Proof:** Immediate consequence of main theorem.\n\n**Theorem (chebyshev_T_leadingCoeff):**\n```\nT_N.leadingCoeff = 2^{N-1}  for N ≥ 1\n```\n\n**Proof:** By induction using recurrence T_{n+2} = 2X·T_{n+1} - T_n. The key is showing deg(2X·T_{n+1}) = n+2 and the subtraction of T_n (lower degree) preserves the leading term.\n\n---\n\n## Technical Challenges Overcome\n\n1. **Complex/Real Conversions:** Power sum computations use complex exponentials (cos x = Re((e^{ix} + e^{-ix})/2)), requiring careful tracking of when quantities are real.\n\n2. **Root Non-degeneracy:** Must prove rotated roots are distinct to construct well-defined polynomials. This follows from injectivity of cos on appropriate intervals.\n\n3. **Index Arithmetic Modulo N:** Discrete orthogonality sums require careful handling of indices modulo N, especially for Chebyshev roots where pairing uses k ↦ N-1-k.\n\n4. **Degree Tracking:** Newton's identities apply only when relating e_m to p_1, ..., p_m. Must verify 0 < j < N to ensure power sums determine all coefficients except constant term.\n\n5. **Special Cases N ∈ {1,2,3}:** For small N, direct computation is more feasible than general machinery. Each case requires explicit evaluation of roots and polynomial products.\n\n---\n\n## Mathematical Significance\n\nThis theorem reveals a **geometric interpretation** of Chebyshev polynomials:\n\n**Classical view:** T_N defined by recurrence or T_N(cos θ) = cos(Nθ)\n\n**New view:** T_N arises naturally from:\n1.

The URL points to a dynamic JavaScript-rendered page that doesn't load properly through web fetching tools. However, I can provide you with a comprehensive analysis based on:\n\n1. General Lean community standards and concerns about AI-written proofs (from my research)\n2. How the Chebyshev Circles project relates to these concerns\n3. Recommendations for writing a traditional math paper that addresses community standards\n\n## Analysis: AI-Written Mathematical Proofs in the Lean Community\n\n### Key Themes and Concerns from the Lean Community\n\nBased on available research into Lean community discussions and practices regarding AI-generated proofs:\n\n**1. Verification vs. Generation Distinction**\n- The community emphasizes that Lean's strength is in **verification**, not trust in AI generation\n- Even AI-generated proofs must be verified by Lean's trusted kernel\n- The correctness guarantee comes from the proof assistant, not the AI\n\n**2. Trust and Hallucination Concerns**\n- LLMs' tendency to hallucinate is a primary concern\n- Community requires that symbolic verification must validate all AI suggestions\n- Proof assistants eliminate the trust bottleneck by providing independent verification\n\n**3. Quality and Rigor Standards**\n- Models tend to \"cut corners,\" producing proofs shorter than rigorous multi-step arguments required\n- The community values proofs that:\n  - Have no `sorry` statements in final deliverables\n  - Meet or exceed Mathlib quality standards\n  - Provide transparent, explainable reasoning\n  - Include proper documentation and comments\n\n**4. Community Reception of AI Assistance**\n- Positive reception when AI finds \"nontrivial\" and \"clever\" proofs\n- 36 GPT-f co-authored commits to Mathlib demonstrate acceptance when quality meets standards\n- Some AI-discovered proofs were shorter and more efficient than human versions\n- However, GPT-4 has not yet proven useful for **novel mathematical problems**\n\n**5. Integration vs. Standalone Use**\n- Existing LLM-based provers don't integrate well into mathematician workflow\n- Tools must work **within** the proof assistant environment, not as external systems\n- The community values tools that enhance human mathematicians rather than replace them\n\n### How Chebyshev Circles Addresses These Concerns\n\nYour project demonstrates several best practices that address community concerns:\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n1. **Complete Verification**: 3,457 lines with zero `sorry` statements\n2. **Transparent Structure**: Clear module organization with documented proof strategy\n3. **Mathematical Rigor**: Uses Newton's identities, discrete orthogonality, proper handling of edge cases\n4. **Explainability**: README explains proof strategy in accessible terms\n5. **Visualization**: Python animations provide geometric intuition\n6. **Reproducibility**: Full CI pipeline, documentation generation, clear build instructions\n\n**What Makes This Work Valuable:**\n\n- It reveals a **novel geometric interpretation** of Chebyshev polynomials\n- Bridges discrete geometry, harmonic analysis, and polynomial theory\n- Provides a non-trivial example of formal verification\n- The proof technique (power sum invariance via discrete orthogonality) is elegant and reusable\n\n### Recommendations for Writing a Traditional Math Paper\n\nTo address community standards and concerns about AI-assisted proofs, your paper should include:\n\n#### 1. **Transparency About Methods**\n\n**Do:**\n- State clearly if AI tools were used in proof development\n- Explain which parts involved AI assistance vs. human reasoning\n- Emphasize that all proofs are formally verified by Lean's kernel\n- Describe the verification process and tool chain\n\n**Example framing:**\n> \"This work demonstrates how AI-assisted proof development, when combined with rigorous formal verification in Lean 4, can produce mathematical results meeting the highest standards of correctness. All proofs presented have been mechanically verified with zero axioms or admitted statements.\"\n\n#### 2. **Mathematical Presentation Standards**\n\n**Structure:**\n- **Abstract**: State the main result clearly and its significance\n- **Introduction**: \n  - Motivate the geometric interpretation\n  - Explain why this perspective on Chebyshev polynomials matters\n  - Preview the proof strategy\n- **Preliminaries**: Define all necessary background (roots of unity, Chebyshev polynomials, Newton's identities)\n- **Main Results**: Present theorems with traditional mathematical exposition\n- **Formal Verification**: Separate section discussing the Lean formalization\n\n**Key elements:**\n- Prove the theorem **twice**: once in traditional mathematical exposition, once by referencing the formal proof\n- Include hand-drawn or computer-generated figures (your animations are excellent)\n- Provide intuition before technical details\n- State all lemmas explicitly even if their formal proofs are routine\n\n#### 3. **Addressing the Formal Verification**\n\n**Essential content:**\n- **Proof Architecture**: Explain the 10-module structure and why this decomposition is natural\n- **Technical Challenges**: Document the difficulties overcome (complex/real conversions, index arithmetic modulo N, degree tracking)\n- **Verification Statistics**: Lines of code, build time, dependencies used\n- **Reproducibility**: Point to GitHub repo, CI badge, documentation\n\n**Credibility markers:**\n- \"All code compiles under Lean 4 v4.25.0-rc2 with Mathlib dependencies\"\n- \"Continuous integration verifies all proofs on each commit\"\n- \"Generated documentation available at [URL]\"\n- \"No axioms, `sorry` statements, or admitted lemmas appear in the final verification\"\n\n#### 4. **Positioning Within Existing Literature**\n\n**Connect to:**\n- Classical results on Chebyshev polynomials\n- Discrete orthogonality in harmonic analysis\n- Newton's identities in symmetric function theory\n- Previous formalizations of orthogonal polynomials in proof assistants\n\n**Emphasize novelty:**\n- This geometric construction of Chebyshev polynomials via rotated roots of unity\n- The role of discrete Fourier orthogonality in understanding power sum invariance\n- The complete formal verification as validation of the approach\n\n#### 5. **Discussion of AI Assistance (if applicable)**\n\nIf AI tools were used, address this head-on:\n\n**Framework for discussion:**\n- **Tool Usage**: Which AI systems were used and for what purposes (proof search, tactic suggestion, lemma discovery)\n- **Human Oversight**: How every step was validated by human understanding and formal verification\n- **Learning Process**: What insights were gained through the AI-human collaboration\n- **Quality Assurance**: How the formal verification guarantees correctness independent of the generation method\n\n**Tone to adopt:**\n- Professional and matter-of-fact\n- Emphasize verification over generation\n- Position AI as a tool that enhances but doesn't replace mathematical reasoning\n- Acknowledge limitations while showcasing capabilities\n\n#### 6. **Mathematical Exposition Quality**\n\n**Standards to meet:**\n- **Clarity**: Every step should be followable by a graduate student in the field\n- **Rigor**: No handwaving; all claims justified\n- **Elegance**: Present the most insightful proof path, not necessarily the mechanically verified one\n- **Pedagogical Value**: Readers should learn something about Chebyshev polynomials, discrete orthogonality, or formal methods\n\n**Specific techniques:**\n- Begin each section with motivation: \"The key insight is...\"\n- Use running examples with small values of N\n- Include proof sketches before full proofs\n- Separate computational verification from conceptual arguments\n\n#### 7. **Acknowledging Limitations**\n\n**Be honest about:**\n- What the formal proof **does** establish (correctness of this specific theorem)\n- What it **doesn't** establish (whether this is the \"best\" or most \"natural\" proof)\n- Computational cost of formal verification\n- Potential generalizations left as future work\n\n### Specific Recommendations for Your Paper Structure\n\n**Suggested Outline:**\n\n```\nTitle: A Geometric Construction of Chebyshev Polynomials via Rotated Roots of Unity\n\nAbstract\n  - State main theorem\n  - Mention complete formal verification\n  - Indicate significance (new geometric perspective)\n\n1.

Mathematics tends to be heavily divided into subdisciplines though.\nAnd I think that could come from LLMs combined with ITPs.\nJoseph Myers\n3:33 AM\nTerence Tao said:\nMy view is that the traditional human-powered way of generating a mathematical proof does not simply produce the final proof text; the process that the human mathematicians go through to reach that proof, trying different strategies, comparing against prior literature, drawing insights from failed attempts, etc., creates significant additional value.

When we build up theory in mathlib for some part of mathematics, we're not just building a text, but a common understanding of how and why that part of mathematics is set up that way in mathlib, what the design tradeoffs involved were, why one approach for expressing concepts formally works better than another, how certain kinds of statements and proofs should be expressed formally, what the common patterns are in statements and proofs that may lead to new definitions and lemmas and tactics that don't appear directly in the informal literature. So a key question for large-scale autoformalization would be how to use it without losing those things. (An AI might readily produce 1000 proofs based on awkwardly set up definitions, and indeed clean up those proofs so that each one is individually high-quality Lean, without complaining that there are common things that are inconvenient in many of those proofs that indicate the initial definitions and API would better have been set up differently.)\nAlex Kontorovich\n6:35 AM\nSome further thoughts on this topic appear here, FYI:... https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.15924\nTimothy Chow\n6:59 AM\nOn the topic of \"AI slop\" overwhelming the system, the CS arXiv recently instituted a policy of rejecting review articles and position papers because it's too easy to create them using LLMs. Unfortunately, ITPs can't really help with this problem.\n You subscribed to  Machine Learning for Theorem Proving. \nMachine Learning for Theorem Proving\n>\n Discussion: AI-written mathematical proofs\nEric Vergo\n1:03 PM\nTerence Tao said:\nIn contrast, machine-generated proofs (whether coming from LLMs, \"good old fashioned AI\", CASs, etc.) can produce proof artefacts which may indeed be completely correct and pass all verification tests, yet lack the penumbra of additional insight and understanding that the human-powered process organically generates.\nI agree if you restrict yourself to considering only the final output of current systems, but that is not the only artifact generated in some workflows. For instance, LLMs interacting with Lean via the lean-lsp MCP generate reasoning traces, code, error message logs, and other intermediate outputs. This means every proof attempt, strategy change, success, failure, and notation modification can be stored and inspected by both humans and other language models. I see no reason why insights extracted from these artifacts could not be used to influence how the LLM writes the final proof and what information is communicated in other domains.\nI would even argue that a mature version of this system (though none exists today) has an advantage in this regard. Humans have imperfect memories and chalkboards get erased. Everything the LLM does in this workflow is text that can be stored in a lossless, immutable, and transparent manner.\nTerence Tao\n11:30 PM\nThis matches my recent experience with using AlphaEvolve: the traces of intermediate AE generation attempts, and our tweaking of the prompts based on the success or failure of those attempts, was actually rather valuable and in some ways more interesting than the final results (even when they beat previous literature). We'll try to make some of these traces available online in the near future. More generally, perhaps moving towards a culture of not just disclosing AI use in research, but showing more of the AI process, e.g., sharing the actual prompts and conversation with an LLM rather than just the final output, may ameliorate some of the critiques against current AI usage practices, though this of course is not a panacea for all AI-related issues.\nEric Vergo\n3:21 PM\nTerence Tao said:\nMore generally, perhaps moving towards a culture of not just disclosing AI use in research, but showing more of the AI process, e.g., sharing the actual prompts and conversation with an LLM rather than just the final output...\nGiven the nature of math and formal verification, setting a standard of ‘full transparency’ seems prudent and consistent with other values driving norms in this space. Are there good arguments against full transparency beyond the overhead added when producing proofs?\nTerence Tao said:\n(this) may ameliorate some of the critiques against current AI usage practices, though this of course is not a panacea for all AI-related issues.\nWe are in full agreement on this point. I have spent a significant amount of time thinking about this and discussing it with mathematicians over the last few years which is why I decided to jump in. It’s nice to see the conversation happening more broadly. This is one of the many challenges, both technical and not, that I do not see how to fully overcome. Moreover, I am of the opinion that we as a community have far less time to prepare for this than the mathematicians that I have spoken to think we do. The scaling laws coupled with better RL techniques are producing consistent trends that are likely to hold. Based on the fact that much larger data centers are going to be coming online in 2026 it would be foolish to assume things are not going to change, and fast.\nAs for Emily’s talk/slide, I detect no sensationalism in her communication and believe she is right to be concerned. I fully endorse her proposal.\nScreenshot 2025-11-11 at 3.03.35 PM.png\n\nShow more\nTimothy Chow\n7:16 PM\nEric Vergo said:\nAre there good arguments against full transparency beyond the overhead added when producing proofs?\nWhat exactly do you mean by \"full transparency\"? Ignoring computers for a moment, traditional mathematical publications do not record every misstep and blind alley along the path to the destination. It may be that we overdo the process of erasing these missteps, but recording everything doesn't seem to me to be the right answer either; it can clutter the exposition and make things much harder to understand.\nGiven that almost everyone reading this is a fan of formalized mathematics to some extent, we probably all support \"full transparency\" of all the formal steps in a proof. But I'm not sure what \"full transparency\" means beyond that.\nAs for Emily’s talk/slide, I detect no sensationalism in her communication and believe she is right to be concerned. I fully endorse her proposal.\nDoes this mean that you think Shalosh B.

Mathematics tends to be heavily divided into subdisciplines though.\nAnd I think that could come from LLMs combined with ITPs.\nJoseph Myers\n3:33 AM\nTerence Tao said:\nMy view is that the traditional human-powered way of generating a mathematical proof does not simply produce the final proof text; the process that the human mathematicians go through to reach that proof, trying different strategies, comparing against prior literature, drawing insights from failed attempts, etc., creates significant additional value. While most of that value would only be of private benefit to the researchers through their increased skill and experience, some of it also flows through into the way these researchers write and present their proof, sometimes in subtle ways such as selecting the order in which different parts of the argument are introduced, changes in notation compared to previous literature, etc..\nThis reminds me of Peter Naur's description of programming as being about building a shared mental model of how and why a program is designed, not just about producing program text, which people have referenced lately (example) in discussions of what is appropriate or inappropriate use of AI code generation when concerned with long-term maintainability.\nWith formalization as a hybrid of mathematics and programming, we can apply such ideas to what would be good or bad uses of autoformalization in library building. When we build up theory in mathlib for some part of mathematics, we're not just building a text, but a common understanding of how and why that part of mathematics is set up that way in mathlib, what the design tradeoffs involved were, why one approach for expressing concepts formally works better than another, how certain kinds of statements and proofs should be expressed formally, what the common patterns are in statements and proofs that may lead to new definitions and lemmas and tactics that don't appear directly in the informal literature. So a key question for large-scale autoformalization would be how to use it without losing those things. (An AI might readily produce 1000 proofs based on awkwardly set up definitions, and indeed clean up those proofs so that each one is individually high-quality Lean, without complaining that there are common things that are inconvenient in many of those proofs that indicate the initial definitions and API would better have been set up differently.)\nAlex Kontorovich\n6:35 AM\nSome further thoughts on this topic appear here, FYI:... https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.15924\nTimothy Chow\n6:59 AM\nOn the topic of \"AI slop\" overwhelming the system, the CS arXiv recently instituted a policy of rejecting review articles and position papers because it's too easy to create them using LLMs. Unfortunately, ITPs can't really help with this problem.\n You subscribed to  Machine Learning for Theorem Proving. \nMachine Learning for Theorem Proving\n>\n Discussion: AI-written mathematical proofs\nEric Vergo\n1:03 PM\nTerence Tao said:\nIn contrast, machine-generated proofs (whether coming from LLMs, \"good old fashioned AI\", CASs, etc.) can produce proof artefacts which may indeed be completely correct and pass all verification tests, yet lack the penumbra of additional insight and understanding that the human-powered process organically generates.\nI agree if you restrict yourself to considering only the final output of current systems, but that is not the only artifact generated in some workflows. For instance, LLMs interacting with Lean via the lean-lsp MCP generate reasoning traces, code, error message logs, and other intermediate outputs. This means every proof attempt, strategy change, success, failure, and notation modification can be stored and inspected by both humans and other language models. I see no reason why insights extracted from these artifacts could not be used to influence how the LLM writes the final proof and what information is communicated in other domains.\nI would even argue that a mature version of this system (though none exists today) has an advantage in this regard. Humans have imperfect memories and chalkboards get erased. Everything the LLM does in this workflow is text that can be stored in a lossless, immutable, and transparent manner.\nTerence Tao\n11:30 PM\nThis matches my recent experience with using AlphaEvolve: the traces of intermediate AE generation attempts, and our tweaking of the prompts based on the success or failure of those attempts, was actually rather valuable and in some ways more interesting than the final results (even when they beat previous literature). We'll try to make some of these traces available online in the near future. More generally, perhaps moving towards a culture of not just disclosing AI use in research, but showing more of the AI process, e.g., sharing the actual prompts and conversation with an LLM rather than just the final output, may ameliorate some of the critiques against current AI usage practices, though this of course is not a panacea for all AI-related issues.\nEric Vergo\n3:21 PM\nTerence Tao said:\nMore generally, perhaps moving towards a culture of not just disclosing AI use in research, but showing more of the AI process, e.g., sharing the actual prompts and conversation with an LLM rather than just the final output...\nGiven the nature of math and formal verification, setting a standard of ‘full transparency’ seems prudent and consistent with other values driving norms in this space. Are there good arguments against full transparency beyond the overhead added when producing proofs?\nTerence Tao said:\n(this) may ameliorate some of the critiques against current AI usage practices, though this of course is not a panacea for all AI-related issues.\nWe are in full agreement on this point. I have spent a significant amount of time thinking about this and discussing it with mathematicians over the last few years which is why I decided to jump in. It’s nice to see the conversation happening more broadly. This is one of the many challenges, both technical and not, that I do not see how to fully overcome. Moreover, I am of the opinion that we as a community have far less time to prepare for this than the mathematicians that I have spoken to think we do. The scaling laws coupled with better RL techniques are producing consistent trends that are likely to hold. Based on the fact that much larger data centers are going to be coming online in 2026 it would be foolish to assume things are not going to change, and fast.\nAs for Emily’s talk/slide, I detect no sensationalism in her communication and believe she is right to be concerned. I fully endorse her proposal.\nScreenshot 2025-11-11 at 3.03.35 PM.png\n\nShow more\nTimothy Chow\n7:16 PM\nEric Vergo said:\nAre there good arguments against full transparency beyond the overhead added when producing proofs?\nWhat exactly do you mean by \"full transparency\"? Ignoring computers for a moment, traditional mathematical publications do not record every misstep and blind alley along the path to the destination. It may be that we overdo the process of erasing these missteps, but recording everything doesn't seem to me to be the right answer either; it can clutter the exposition and make things much harder to understand.\nGiven that almost everyone reading this is a fan of formalized mathematics to some extent, we probably all support \"full transparency\" of all the formal steps in a proof. But I'm not sure what \"full transparency\" means beyond that.\nAs for Emily’s talk/slide, I detect no sensationalism in her communication and believe she is right to be concerned.

Rather than defining them via recurrence relations or cosine composition, we can construct them by:\n    53→1. Taking N equally-spaced points on the unit circle\n    54→2. Rotating them by any angle φ\n    55→3. Projecting onto the real axis\n    56→4. Building the monic polynomial with these projections as roots\n    57→5.

Rather than defining them via recurrence relations or cosine composition, we can construct them by:\n1. Taking N equally-spaced points on the unit circle\n2. Rotating them by any angle φ\n3. Projecting onto the real axis\n4. Building the monic polynomial with these projections as roots\n5. Scaling by 2^(N-1)\n\nThe result is always T_N(x) plus a constant. This provides a bridge between:\n- **Discrete geometry** (roots of unity on the circle)\n- **Harmonic analysis** (discrete orthogonality relations)\n- **Polynomial theory** (Chebyshev polynomials)\n\n## Project Organization\n\nThis project is split into two main components: (1) Python scripts used to generate animated gifs visualizing the behavior that results from the proof statement, and (2) A complete verification structured into 10 modules totaling 3,457 lines of Lean 4 code:\n\n| Module | Lines | Purpose |\n|--------|-------|---------|\n| [RootsOfUnity.lean](ChebyshevCircles/RootsOfUnity.lean) | 108 | Root definitions and list properties |\n| [PolynomialConstruction.lean](ChebyshevCircles/PolynomialConstruction.lean) | 541 | Polynomial construction from roots |\n| [TrigonometricIdentities.lean](ChebyshevCircles/TrigonometricIdentities.lean) | 137 | Trigonometric sum identities |\n| [ChebyshevRoots.lean](ChebyshevCircles/ChebyshevRoots.lean) | 235 | Chebyshev root characterization |\n| [PowerSums.lean](ChebyshevCircles/PowerSums.lean) | 705 | Power sum φ-invariance |\n| [NewtonIdentities.lean](ChebyshevCircles/NewtonIdentities.lean) | 317 | Newton's identities framework |\n| [PolynomialProperties.lean](ChebyshevCircles/PolynomialProperties.lean) | 130 | Polynomial degree and coefficient properties |\n| [PowerSumEquality.lean](ChebyshevCircles/PowerSumEquality.lean) | 273 | General power sum equality |\n| [ChebyshevOrthogonality.lean](ChebyshevCircles/ChebyshevOrthogonality.lean) | 538 | Discrete orthogonality relations |\n| [MainTheorem.lean](ChebyshevCircles/MainTheorem.lean) | 473 | Main theorem and supporting results |\n\n## Proof Strategy\n\nThe verification follows a carefully structured approach:\n\n**Step 1: Root Characterization**\nBoth the rotated roots and Chebyshev roots can be expressed as cosines of equally-spaced angles (modulo phase shifts). This parallel structure is established in `ChebyshevRoots.lean`.\n\n**Step 2: Power Sum Invariance**\nThe key insight: For any polynomial, power sums of its roots determine all coefficients (via Newton's identities). We prove in `PowerSums.lean` that:\n```lean\n∑_{k=0}^{N-1} cos(φ + 2πk/N)^m = ∑_{k=0}^{N-1} cos(2πk/N)^m\n```\nfor all m > 0. This shows the rotated roots and unrotated roots have identical power sums (except m=0).\n\n**Step 3: Discrete Orthogonality**\nThe power sum equality relies on discrete orthogonality of complex exponentials over N-th roots of unity. `ChebyshevOrthogonality.lean` proves:\n```lean\n∑_{k=0}^{N-1} exp(i·j·2πk/N) = 0  (when j ≠ 0 mod N)\n```\nThis is the discrete analog of continuous Fourier orthogonality.\n\n**Step 4: Newton's Identities**\n`NewtonIdentities.lean` implements the bridge between power sums and elementary symmetric polynomials (which determine polynomial coefficients). For polynomials of the same degree with identical power sums (except the 0-th), all coefficients match except the constant term.\n\n**Step 5: Assembly**\n`MainTheorem.lean` combines these results: since scaled polynomials from rotated and unrotated roots have identical non-constant coefficients and the same degree, they differ only by a constant. The unrotated case (φ=0) is shown to equal T_N.\n\n**Technical Challenges Overcome:**\n- Handling complex/real conversions in power sum computations\n- Proving non-degeneracy of roots (no duplicates) for polynomial construction\n- Managing index arithmetic modulo N in discrete sums\n- Careful degree tracking to apply Newton's identities correctly\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n**Mathematical Background:**\n- Undergraduate algebra: polynomials, roots, symmetric functions\n- Complex numbers and exponentials\n- Trigonometric identities\n- Familiarity with orthogonal polynomials (helpful but not required)\n\n**Software Requirements:**\n- [Lean 4](https://leanprover.github.io/) (v4.25.0-rc2)\n- [Lake](https://github.com/leanprover/lake) (Lean's build tool, included with Lean)\n- [Python 3.7+](https://www.python.org/) (for visualizations only)\n\n**Expected Build Time:** ~5-10 minutes on first build (compiles Mathlib dependencies)\n\n## Installation\n\n### Lean 4 Verification\n\n1. **Install Lean 4:**\n   ```bash\n   # Via elan (recommended)\n   curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leanprover/elan/master/elan-init.sh -sSf | sh\n   ```\n\n2. **Clone and build:**\n   ```bash\n   git clone https://github.com/e-vergo/ChebyshevCircles.git\n   cd ChebyshevCircles\n   lake exe cache get  # Download cached Mathlib builds (optional but recommended)\n   lake build\n   ```\n\n3. **Verify the proof:**\n   ```bash\n   lake build ChebyshevCircles\n   ```\n   If successful, all 3,457 lines of proof are verified with no `sorry` statements.\n\n### Python Visualizations\n\n1. **Create virtual environment:**\n   ```bash\n   python3 -m venv .venv\n   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\\Scripts\\activate\n   ```\n\n2. **Install dependencies:**\n   ```bash\n   pip install -r requirements.txt\n   ```\n\n3. **Generate animations:**\n   ```bash\n   python main.py\n   ```\n   This creates 6 GIF files in `chebyshev_gifs/` (one for each N ∈ {3,4,5,6,12,13}).\n\n## Usage\n\n**Explore the proofs:**\n```bash\n# Open in VS Code with Lean 4 extension\ncode ChebyshevCircles/MainTheorem.lean\n\n# Check a specific module\nlake build ChebyshevCircles.PowerSums\n\n# View generated documentation (after GitHub Pages deployment)\n# Navigate to: https://e-vergo.github.io/ChebyshevCircles/\n```\n\n**Examine proof states:**\nThe Lean 4 VS Code extension shows the proof state (goals and hypotheses) at any cursor position.

Each primitive N-th root ω is multiplied by exp(iφ), yielding elements of the form exp(i(φ + 2πk/N)).\n\n**realProjections (N : ℕ) (φ : ℝ)**: The real parts of rotated roots of unity. These are the values that will become roots of the constructed polynomial.\n\n**realProjectionsList (N : ℕ) (φ : ℝ)**: An ordered list representation: [cos(φ + 2πk/N) : k ∈ [0, N)]\n\n#### Main Theorems\n\n**realProjection_eq_cos**: The real projection of the k-th rotated root equals cos(φ + 2πk/N). This establishes the explicit trigonometric form of the projections.\n\n**realProjection_mem_Icc**: All real projections lie in [-1, 1], following from the range of cosine.\n\n**card_realProjectionsList**: The list has exactly N elements.\n\n**realProjectionsList_sum**: The sum of real projections equals the Finset sum ∑_{k=0}^{N-1} cos(φ + 2πk/N).\n\n**realProjectionsList_powersum**: The j-th power sum equals ∑_{k=0}^{N-1} cos(φ + 2πk/N)^j.\n\n#### Mathematical Content\n\nThis module establishes the geometric foundation: we take the N equally-spaced points on the unit circle (primitive N-th roots of unity), rotate the entire configuration by angle φ, and project onto the real axis. This yields N real numbers in [-1, 1] that will serve as roots of a polynomial. The key insight is that these projections have a simple trigonometric form, enabling the use of trigonometric identities to analyze the resulting polynomial.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **PolynomialConstruction.lean** - Building Polynomials from Roots\n\n#### Definitions\n\n**polynomialFromRealRoots (roots : List ℝ)**: Constructs the monic polynomial (X - r₁)(X - r₂)⋯(X - rₙ) from a list of roots.\n\n**unscaledPolynomial (N : ℕ) (φ : ℝ)**: The monic polynomial with roots at cos(φ + 2πk/N) for k = 0, ..., N-1.

Given the N real projections, we form the monic polynomial having these as roots, then scale by 2^(N-1). The crucial result is that the constant term varies with φ while (as will be shown using Newton's identities) higher-degree coefficients do not. This non-trivial variation establishes that the polynomial genuinely depends on φ in a controlled way.\n\nThe proof that the constant term varies uses explicit angle choices (typically φ = 0 vs φ = π/2) and number-theoretic arguments showing that cos(2πk/N) ≠ 0 for certain k values when N is odd and sufficiently large.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **TrigonometricIdentities.lean** - Vanishing Sums\n\n#### Main Theorems\n\n**sum_cos_roots_of_unity**: For N ≥ 2, ∑_{k=0}^{N-1} cos(φ + 2πk/N) = 0.\n\n**sum_cos_multiple_rotated_roots**: For 0 < m < N, ∑_{k=0}^{N-1} cos(m(φ + 2πk/N)) = 0.\n\n**cos_cube_formula**: Power reduction formula cos³(x) = (cos(3x) + 3cos(x))/4.\n\n**list_foldr_eq_multiset_prod**: Technical lemma relating list-based polynomial construction to multiset products.\n\n#### Mathematical Content\n\nThe key results here exploit the structure of roots of unity. The sum ∑_{k=0}^{N-1} exp(i(φ + 2πk/N)) = exp(iφ) ∑_{k=0}^{N-1} exp(2πik/N) = 0 because the N-th roots of unity sum to zero (they're vertices of a regular N-gon centered at origin). Taking real parts gives the cosine sum identity.\n\nFor multiples: ∑_{k=0}^{N-1} cos(m(φ + 2πk/N)) = Re(exp(imφ) ∑_{k=0}^{N-1} exp(2πimk/N)). Since 0 < m < N, the complex numbers exp(2πim/N) form the vertices of a regular N-gon (rotated by angle 2πm/N from the standard roots), so their sum is zero.\n\nThese vanishing sums are **fundamental** - they ensure that when we express power sums ∑ cos^j using power-reduction formulas, all non-constant trigonometric terms disappear, leaving only φ-independent contributions.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **ChebyshevRoots.lean** - Characterizing Chebyshev Roots\n\n#### Definitions\n\n**chebyshevRoot (N k : ℕ)**: The k-th root of T_N, defined as cos((2k+1)π/(2N)).\n\n**chebyshevRootsList (N : ℕ)**: List of all N Chebyshev roots.\n\n#### Main Theorems\n\n**chebyshevRoot_in_Icc**: All Chebyshev roots lie in [-1, 1].\n\n**chebyshev_T_eval_chebyshevRoot**: T_N(cos((2k+1)π/(2N))) = 0.

Proof uses injectivity of cosine on [0, π] and the fact that the angles (2k+1)π/(2N) are strictly ordered in [0, π].\n\n**chebyshev_T_eval_eq_zero_forward**: If T_N(x) = 0, then x is one of the N Chebyshev roots. Proof by contradiction: if x were an additional root, T_N would have N+1 roots, contradicting its degree N.\n\n**chebyshev_T_eval_eq_zero_iff**: Complete characterization - T_N(x) = 0 iff x = cos((2k+1)π/(2N)) for some k < N.\n\n#### Mathematical Content\n\nThis module establishes the **exact root set** of Chebyshev polynomials T_N. The roots are located at the cosines of equally-spaced \"odd multiples of π/(2N)\" angles. These are precisely the projections onto the real axis of N equally-spaced points on the unit circle, offset by π/(2N) from the standard roots of unity.\n\nThe completeness of the characterization (forward and backward directions) is essential for the main theorem. It shows that:\n1. Chebyshev polynomials have degree exactly N with N distinct real roots in [-1, 1]\n2. The roots have the explicit trigonometric form given\n3. No other values in ℝ are roots\n\nThis sets up the connection to the rotated roots of unity: when φ = π/(2N), the real projections cos(π/(2N) + 2πk/N) = cos((2k+1)π/(2N)) are exactly the Chebyshev roots.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **PowerSums.lean** - φ-Invariance of Power Sums\n\n#### Main Theorems\n\n**powerSumCos_invariant_j2 through powerSumCos_invariant_j6**: Explicit proofs for small powers using power-reduction formulas. Each reduces cos^j to a linear combination of cos(mx) for various m, then applies the vanishing sum identities.\n\n**powerSumCos_invariant**: **General theorem** - For 0 < j < N, ∑_{k=0}^{N-1} cos(θ₁ + 2πk/N)^j = ∑_{k=0}^{N-1} cos(θ₂ + 2πk/N)^j.\n\n**sum_cos_pow_eq_sum_binomial**: Expresses ∑ cos^j as a sum over binomial expansion with vanishing non-constant terms.\n\n**sum_cos_int_multiple_vanishes**: Generalizes the vanishing sum to integer multiples (including negative).\n\n#### Mathematical Content\n\nThis is the **heart of the φ-invariance proof**. The strategy:\n\n1. **Power-reduction formulas**: Express cos^j(x) as a linear combination of cos(mx) for m = 0, j, 2j, 3j, ... (derived using cos(x) = (e^{ix} + e^{-ix})/2 and binomial expansion).\n\n2. **Binomial expansion approach**: cos^j(x) = (e^{ix} + e^{-ix})^j / 2^j = (1/2^j) ∑_{r=0}^j (j choose r) e^{i(2r-j)x}. Taking real parts gives cos^j(x) as a linear combination of cos((2r-j)x).\n\n3. **Summation over roots**: ∑_{k=0}^{N-1} cos((2r-j)(θ + 2πk/N))\n   - If 2r - j = 0, this sum equals N (constant term, φ-independent)\n   - If 2r - j ≠ 0 and |2r - j| < N (which holds since r ≤ j < N), the sum vanishes by the multiple-root identity\n\n4. **Conclusion**: All θ-dependent terms vanish, leaving only constant contributions. Therefore the power sum is independent of θ.\n\nThis is a beautiful application of the **geometric structure of roots of unity** combined with **harmonic analysis** (Fourier-type decomposition of powers of cosine).\n\n---\n\n### 6. **NewtonIdentities.lean** - From Power Sums to Coefficients\n\n#### Main Theorems\n\n**multiset_newton_identity**: For a multiset s and m > 0,\n   m · e_m = (-1)^{m+1} ∑_{i+j=m, i<m} (-1)^i · e_i · p_j\nwhere e_k is the k-th elementary symmetric function and p_j is the j-th power sum.\n\n**esymm_eq_of_psum_eq**: If two multisets have equal cardinality and equal power sums (for all 0 < j < card), then they have equal elementary symmetric functions.\n\n**esymm_rotated_roots_invariant**: The elementary symmetric polynomials in the rotated roots cos(φ + 2πk/N) are φ-invariant for 0 < m < N.\n\n**polynomial_coeff_eq_of_esymm_eq**: Equal elementary symmetric functions imply equal polynomial coefficients (via Vieta's formulas).\n\n#### Mathematical Content\n\nThis module provides the **algebraic bridge** from power-sum invariance to coefficient invariance.\n\n**Newton's identities** express elementary symmetric functions recursively in terms of power sums:\n- e_1 = p_1\n- 2e_2 = e_1·p_1 - p_2\n- 3e_3 = e_2·p_1 - e_1·p_2 + p_3\n- etc.\n\nBy strong induction:\n1. **Base case**: e_1 = p_1/1, and p_1 = ∑ cos(φ + 2πk/N) = 0 for N ≥ 2 (by the vanishing sum)\n2. **Inductive step**: For m > 1, Newton's identity expresses m·e_m in terms of {e_i : i < m} and {p_j : j ≤ m}. By IH, the e_i with i < m are φ-invariant. By powerSumCos_invariant, the p_j with 0 < j < N are φ-invariant. Therefore e_m is φ-invariant.\n\n**Vieta's formulas** then connect elementary symmetric functions to polynomial coefficients:\n- For a polynomial (X - r_1)⋯(X - r_N) = ∑_{k=0}^N c_k X^k,\n- c_k = (-1)^{N-k} · e_{N-k}\n\nSince the e_m are φ-invariant for 0 < m < N, the coefficients c_k are φ-invariant for 0 < k ≤ N.

This yields N real numbers in [-1, 1] that will serve as roots of a polynomial. The key insight is that these projections have a simple trigonometric form, enabling the use of trigonometric identities to analyze the resulting polynomial.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **PolynomialConstruction.lean** - Building Polynomials from Roots\n\n#### Definitions\n\n**polynomialFromRealRoots (roots : List ℝ)**: Constructs the monic polynomial (X - r₁)(X - r₂)⋯(X - rₙ) from a list of roots.\n\n**unscaledPolynomial (N : ℕ) (φ : ℝ)**: The monic polynomial with roots at cos(φ + 2πk/N) for k = 0, ..., N-1.

Since cos is strictly decreasing on [0, π], the cosines are distinct.\n\n**Lemma (chebyshev_T_eval_eq_zero_iff):** \n```\nT_N(x) = 0  ⟺  ∃k ∈ {0,...,N-1}, x = ρ_k\n```\n\n**Proof:** T_N has degree N and has N distinct roots {ρ_0, ..., ρ_{N-1}}.

Both {r_0(0), ..., r_{N-1}(0)} and {ρ_0, ..., ρ_{N-1}} have the same power sums for 0 < j < N (via general_powersum_equality in PowerSumEquality.lean)\n2. By Newton's identities, they have the same elementary symmetric functions\n3. Since both polynomials have the same degree N and leading coefficient 2^{N-1}, their coefficients match for k > 0\n\n### STEP 5.5: General Power Sum Equality (PowerSumEquality.lean)\n\n**Critical Lemma (general_powersum_equality):**\n\nFor 0 < j < N:\n```\n∑_{k=0}^{N-1} cos(2πk/N)^j = ∑_{k=0}^{N-1} cos((2k+1)π/(2N))^j\n```\n\n**Proof for rotated roots (φ=0):** Uses binomial expansion from Step 3.\n\n**Proof for Chebyshev roots:** Uses analogous binomial expansion combined with Chebyshev-specific orthogonality:\n```\n∑_{k=0}^{N-1} cos((2k+1)π/(2N))^j = 2^{-j} · ∑_{r=0}^j C(j,r) · ∑_{k=0}^{N-1} cos((2r-j)(2k+1)π/(2N))\n```\n\nThe inner sums vanish for 2r ≠ j by the Chebyshev orthogonality relation (Step 2).\n\n**Result:** Both power sums evaluate to the same closed form:\n```\n{ N · 2^{-j} · C(j, j/2)  if j even\n{ 0                        if j odd\n```\n\n---\n\n## FINAL ASSEMBLY (MainTheorem.lean, line 446)\n\n**Theorem (rotated_roots_yield_chebyshev):**\n```lean\ntheorem rotated_roots_yield_chebyshev (N : ℕ) (θ : ℝ) (hN : 0 < N) :\n    ∃ (c : ℝ), scaledPolynomial N θ = Polynomial.Chebyshev.T ℝ N + C c\n```\n\n**Proof:**\n1.

This follows from injectivity of cos on appropriate intervals.\n\n3. **Index Arithmetic Modulo N:** Discrete orthogonality sums require careful handling of indices modulo N, especially for Chebyshev roots where pairing uses k ↦ N-1-k.\n\n4. **Degree Tracking:** Newton's identities apply only when relating e_m to p_1, ..., p_m. Must verify 0 < j < N to ensure power sums determine all coefficients except constant term.\n\n5. **Special Cases N ∈ {1,2,3}:** For small N, direct computation is more feasible than general machinery.

Terms pair up and cancel via the involution k ↦ N-1-k.\n\n### STEP 3: Power Sum Invariance (PowerSums.lean)\n\n**Key Binomial Expansion (sum_cos_pow_eq_sum_binomial):**\n\nUsing cos(x) = (e^{ix} + e^{-ix})/2 and binomial theorem:\n```\n∑_{k=0}^{N-1} cos(θ + 2πk/N)^j = 2^{-j} · ∑_{r=0}^j C(j,r) · ∑_{k=0}^{N-1} cos((2r-j)(θ + 2πk/N))\n```\n\n**Analysis of Terms:**\n- When 2r - j ≠ 0: The inner sum vanishes by discrete orthogonality (assuming |2r-j| < N)\n- When 2r = j (middle term, requires j even): ∑ cos(0) = N\n\n**Conclusion:** For 0 < j < N:\n```\n∑_{k=0}^{N-1} cos(θ + 2πk/N)^j = { N · 2^{-j} · C(j, j/2)  if j even\n                                 { 0                        if j odd\n```\n\nThis value is **independent of θ**.\n\n**Main Invariance Theorem (sum_cos_pow_theta_independent):**\n```\n∑_{k=0}^{N-1} cos(θ₁ + 2πk/N)^j = ∑_{k=0}^{N-1} cos(θ₂ + 2πk/N)^j  for 0 < j < N\n```\n\n### STEP 4: Newton's Identities (NewtonIdentities.lean)\n\n**Newton's Identities relate power sums p_j = ∑ x_i^j to elementary symmetric functions e_m:**\n\nFor m > 0:\n```\nm · e_m = (-1)^{m+1} · ∑_{i=0}^{m-1} (-1)^i · e_i · p_{m-i}\n```\n\n**Key Consequence (esymm_eq_of_psum_eq):**\n\nIf two multisets s and t have:\n1. Same cardinality: |s| = |t|\n2. Same power sums: p_j(s) = p_j(t) for all 0 < j < |s|\n\nThen: e_m(s) = e_m(t) for all 0 ≤ m < |s|\n\n**Proof:** By induction on m using Newton's identity. The base case e_0 = 1 is trivial. For m > 0, Newton's identity expresses e_m in terms of e_0, ..., e_{m-1} and p_1, ..., p_m. By induction hypothesis, e_0, ..., e_{m-1} match, and by assumption p_1, ..., p_m match, hence e_m matches.\n\n**Application to Rotated Roots (esymm_rotated_roots_invariant):**\n\nSince power sums of rotated roots are φ-invariant (Step 3), Newton's identities imply:\n```\ne_m({r_0(φ₁), ..., r_{N-1}(φ₁)}) = e_m({r_0(φ₂), ..., r_{N-1}(φ₂)})  for 0 < m < N\n```\n\n### STEP 5: Coefficient Matching (PolynomialProperties.lean)\n\n**Vieta's Formulas connect elementary symmetric functions to polynomial coefficients:**\n\nFor polynomial ∏(x - r_i) = ∑ a_k x^k:\n```\na_k = (-1)^{N-k} · e_{N-k}({r_0, ..., r_{N-1}})\n```\n\n**Theorem (constant_term_only_varies):**\n```\nscaledPolynomial(N, φ₁).coeff(k) = scaledPolynomial(N, φ₂).coeff(k)  for all k > 0\n```\n\n**Proof:** \n1. Use Vieta: coeff(k) depends on e_{N-k}\n2. For k > 0, we have N - k < N\n3. By Step 4, e_{N-k} is φ-invariant\n4. Therefore coeff(k) is φ-invariant\n\n**Special Case: φ = 0**\n\nFor φ = 0, the rotated roots are cos(2πk/N), which are closely related to Chebyshev roots (different phase).\n\n**Theorem (scaledPolynomial_matches_chebyshev_at_zero):**\n```\nscaledPolynomial(N, 0).coeff(k) = T_N.coeff(k)  for all k > 0\n```\n\n**Proof Strategy:**\n- **Cases N = 1, 2, 3:** Direct computation by evaluating roots and polynomial coefficients\n- **Case N ≥ 4:** Use power sum equality\n\nFor N ≥ 4, the proof shows:\n1. Both {r_0(0), ..., r_{N-1}(0)} and {ρ_0, ..., ρ_{N-1}} have the same power sums for 0 < j < N (via general_powersum_equality in PowerSumEquality.lean)\n2. By Newton's identities, they have the same elementary symmetric functions\n3. Since both polynomials have the same degree N and leading coefficient 2^{N-1}, their coefficients match for k > 0\n\n### STEP 5.5: General Power Sum Equality (PowerSumEquality.lean)\n\n**Critical Lemma (general_powersum_equality):**\n\nFor 0 < j < N:\n```\n∑_{k=0}^{N-1} cos(2πk/N)^j = ∑_{k=0}^{N-1} cos((2k+1)π/(2N))^j\n```\n\n**Proof for rotated roots (φ=0):** Uses binomial expansion from Step 3.\n\n**Proof for Chebyshev roots:** Uses analogous binomial expansion combined with Chebyshev-specific orthogonality:\n```\n∑_{k=0}^{N-1} cos((2k+1)π/(2N))^j = 2^{-j} · ∑_{r=0}^j C(j,r) · ∑_{k=0}^{N-1} cos((2r-j)(2k+1)π/(2N))\n```\n\nThe inner sums vanish for 2r ≠ j by the Chebyshev orthogonality relation (Step 2).\n\n**Result:** Both power sums evaluate to the same closed form:\n```\n{ N · 2^{-j} · C(j, j/2)  if j even\n{ 0                        if j odd\n```\n\n---\n\n## FINAL ASSEMBLY (MainTheorem.lean, line 446)\n\n**Theorem (rotated_roots_yield_chebyshev):**\n```lean\ntheorem rotated_roots_yield_chebyshev (N : ℕ) (θ : ℝ) (hN : 0 < N) :\n    ∃ (c : ℝ), scaledPolynomial N θ = Polynomial.Chebyshev.T ℝ N + C c\n```\n\n**Proof:**\n1. Set c = scaledPolynomial(N, θ).coeff(0) - T_N.coeff(0)\n2. For k = 0: By definition of c, both sides have the same constant term\n3. For k > 0:\n   ```\n   scaledPolynomial(N, θ).coeff(k)\n     = scaledPolynomial(N, 0).coeff(k)          [by constant_term_only_varies]\n     = T_N.coeff(k)                             [by scaledPolynomial_matches_chebyshev_at_zero]\n     = (T_N + C c).coeff(k)                     [since C c contributes 0 to coeff k > 0]\n   ```\n4. Since all coefficients match, the polynomials are equal. ∎\n\n---\n\n## Supporting Theorems\n\n**Theorem (rotated_roots_coeffs_match_chebyshev):** Explicitly states:\n```\nscaledPolynomial(N, θ).coeff(k) = T_N.coeff(k)  for all k > 0\n```\n\n**Proof:** Immediate consequence of main theorem.\n\n**Theorem (chebyshev_T_leadingCoeff):**\n```\nT_N.leadingCoeff = 2^{N-1}  for N ≥ 1\n```\n\n**Proof:** By induction using recurrence T_{n+2} = 2X·T_{n+1} - T_n. The key is showing deg(2X·T_{n+1}) = n+2 and the subtraction of T_n (lower degree) preserves the leading term.\n\n---\n\n## Technical Challenges Overcome\n\n1. **Complex/Real Conversions:** Power sum computations use complex exponentials (cos x = Re((e^{ix} + e^{-ix})/2)), requiring careful tracking of when quantities are real.\n\n2. **Root Non-degeneracy:** Must prove rotated roots are distinct to construct well-defined polynomials. This follows from injectivity of cos on appropriate intervals.\n\n3. **Index Arithmetic Modulo N:** Discrete orthogonality sums require careful handling of indices modulo N, especially for Chebyshev roots where pairing uses k ↦ N-1-k.\n\n4. **Degree Tracking:** Newton's identities apply only when relating e_m to p_1, ..., p_m. Must verify 0 < j < N to ensure power sums determine all coefficients except constant term.\n\n5. **Special Cases N ∈ {1,2,3}:** For small N, direct computation is more feasible than general machinery. Each case requires explicit evaluation of roots and polynomial products.\n\n---\n\n## Mathematical Significance\n\nThis theorem reveals a **geometric interpretation** of Chebyshev polynomials:\n\n**Classical view:** T_N defined by recurrence or T_N(cos θ) = cos(Nθ)\n\n**New view:** T_N arises naturally from:\n1. Taking N equally-spaced points on the unit circle\n2. Rotating by ANY angle φ  \n3. Projecting onto real axis\n4. Building monic polynomial with these projections as roots\n5. Scaling by 2^{N-1}\n\nThe resulting polynomial differs from T_N only by a constant (which depends on φ).\n\n**Deep Connection:** This bridges:\n- **Discrete geometry** (roots of unity on circle)\n- **Harmonic analysis** (discrete Fourier orthogonality: ∑ ω^{km} = 0)\n- **Polynomial theory** (Chebyshev polynomials, symmetric functions)\n- **Approximation theory** (Chebyshev polynomials are optimal in various senses)\n\nThe φ-invariance of non-constant coefficients is fundamentally a consequence of discrete orthogonality of roots of unity—a manifestation of the discrete Fourier transform on finite cyclic groups.\n\n---\n\n## Proof Statistics\n\n- **Total lines of Lean 4 code:** 3,457\n- **Number of modules:** 10\n- **Main theorem location:** MainTheorem.lean, line 446\n- **Verified with:** 0 sorry statements (complete formal proof)\n\n**Module breakdown:**\n1.

Write a blog post explaining the journey and insights gained\n\n### Key Takeaway\n\nThe Lean community values **correctness, clarity, and contribution**. Your Chebyshev Circles project demonstrates all three. A paper that presents the mathematical result clearly, explains the formal verification process transparently, and emphasizes the novel geometric insight will be well-received.\n\nThe fact that formal verification was used (possibly with AI assistance) is a strength, not a weakness - it provides an additional layer of confidence beyond traditional peer review.

Conclusion\n\nAppendix A: Selected Lean Code Excerpts\nAppendix B: Complete Proof Dependencies\n```\n\n### Addressing Specific Community Concerns\n\n**For each concern, your response:**\n\n| Concern | Your Paper's Response |\n|---------|----------------------|\n| AI hallucination | \"All proofs mechanically verified by Lean's trusted kernel\" |\n| Cutting corners | \"Complete 3,457-line verification with no admitted statements\" |\n| Explainability | \"Proof strategy explained in Section 3 with geometric intuition\" |\n| Quality | \"Follows Mathlib conventions; CI ensures ongoing correctness\" |\n| Novelty | \"New geometric interpretation bridges three mathematical domains\" |\n| Reproducibility | \"Open-source repository with full build instructions and CI\" |\n| Trust | \"Independent verification possible; proof checkable by any Lean installation\" |\n\n### Comparison to Community Standards\n\nBased on the GPT-f example where 36 AI-assisted commits were accepted into Mathlib, your work should emphasize:\n\n1. **Correctness**: Verified by Lean (meets standard)\n2. **Efficiency**: Are your proofs as concise as possible? (Review for optimization opportunities)\n3. **Clarity**: Are tactics and strategies clear? (Add comments)\n4. **Contribution**: Does this add value? (Yes - novel geometric interpretation)\n5. **Maintenance**: Is the code maintainable? (Module structure suggests yes)\n\n### Final Recommendations\n\n**For the paper:**\n1. Lead with mathematics, not tooling\n2. Make the geometric insight the hero of the story\n3. Present formal verification as validation, not the main contribution\n4. Include beautiful figures and clear exposition\n5. Be transparent about methods while emphasizing rigor\n6. Connect to classical literature on Chebyshev polynomials\n7. Explain why this matters beyond formal verification\n\n**For community engagement:**\n1. Share on Lean Zulip with humble framing: \"seeking feedback on this formalization\"\n2. Acknowledge that this is a learning exercise as well as a mathematical contribution\n3. Be responsive to suggestions for improvement\n4. Consider submitting key lemmas to Mathlib if they're of general utility\n5. Write a blog post explaining the journey and insights gained\n\n### Key Takeaway\n\nThe Lean community values **correctness, clarity, and contribution**. Your Chebyshev Circles project demonstrates all three. A paper that presents the mathematical result clearly, explains the formal verification process transparently, and emphasizes the novel geometric insight will be well-received.\n\nThe fact that formal verification was used (possibly with AI assistance) is a strength, not a weakness - it provides an additional layer of confidence beyond traditional peer review. Frame it that way, and your work will exemplify the best of modern formally-verified mathematics."}],"totalDurationMs":137202,"totalTokens":30433,"totalToolUseCount":11,"usage":{"input_tokens":167,"cache_creation_input_tokens":675,"cache_read_input_tokens":26731,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":675,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":2860,"service_tier":"standard"}}}

(Not sure I agree with the solution, and I don’t know if Emily does either, or is just being provocative, but I commend the discussion of the problem.)\nRado Kirov\n7:05 PM\ndoes \"communicated in natural language text\" mean 1) something akin to code comments, proving intuition and motivations, but non-rigorous 2) closer to current standard of rigorous math proofs but not formal?\nKevin Buzzard\n7:38 PM\nmy impression was that it just meant \"looks like a math paper\".\nTimothy Chow\n9:19 PM\nI have a pet peeve about the term \"AI system.\" What does that mean? For decades, the mathematical literature has been accumulating computer-assisted proofs. Are these no longer to be considered proofs until they are certified by an ITP? Or do they get a pass as long as the computer does something other than generating \"text\"? What about Doron Zeilberger's trusty co-author Shalosh B. Ekhad, which often generates \"mathematical text\" to accompany WZ-style proofs? I understand that we want to do something to prevent LLM-generated texts from being uncritically accepted as valid mathematical arguments, but being sloppy about what we mean by an \"AI system\" is an inauspicious start.\nAlex Meiburg\n9:30 PM\nIt specifically says \"artificially generated mathematical text\" as the domain of where this applies. A system like Vampire or Mathematica can certainly be a proof still under this definition.\nTimothy Chow\n9:44 PM\nAs I said, Shalosh B. Ekhad generates mathematical text. And aren't formulas also \"text\"? Mathematica typically generates human-readable output (which is what I think of as \"text\"), not binary files.\n  9:49 PM\nIn any case, I don't think the crucial word is \"text\". It's whether the content has been verified in a satisfactory manner. If a mathematical argument has been properly vetted then its origin doesn't matter, surely? Focusing on the origin seems to be focusing on the wrong thing.\n  10:04 PM\nTo put it another way, if Mathematica spits out an integral, then I think we can have a healthy discussion about whether to trust it, but I don't want to frame the discussion as a debate about \"is Mathematica AI?\" or \"is an equation text?\"\nTerence Tao\n10:25 PM\nMy view is that the traditional human-powered way of generating a mathematical proof does not simply produce the final proof text; the process that the human mathematicians go through to reach that proof, trying different strategies, comparing against prior literature, drawing insights from failed attempts, etc., creates significant additional value. While most of that value would only be of private benefit to the researchers through their increased skill and experience, some of it also flows through into the way these researchers write and present their proof, sometimes in subtle ways such as selecting the order in which different parts of the argument are introduced, changes in notation compared to previous literature, etc..\nIn contrast, machine-generated proofs (whether coming from LLMs, \"good old fashioned AI\", CASs, etc.) can produce proof artefacts which may indeed be completely correct and pass all verification tests, yet lack the penumbra of additional insight and understanding that the human-powered process organically generates. (cf. Thurston's well known essay on proof and progress in mathematics, or my own short post on the three stages of mathematics which Emily also quotes from.) My interpretation of Emily's proposal is that it is intended to ensure that contributions to the mathematical literature continue to generate both types of valuable mathematical outputs even when the traditional mechanism for generating the latter output is absent.\nNotification Bot\n3:47 AM\n11 messages were moved here from #general > Lean in the wild by Floris van Doorn.\nFloris van Doorn\n3:47 AM\nThis seems like an interesting discussion, and there is a lot to say about it, so I've split it into a separate thread.\nTimothy Chow\n7:22 PM\nTerence Tao said:\nIn contrast, machine-generated proofs (whether coming from LLMs, \"good old fashioned AI\", CASs, etc.) can produce proof artefacts which may indeed be completely correct and pass all verification tests, yet lack the penumbra of additional insight and understanding that the human-powered process organically generates. ... My interpretation of Emily's proposal is that it is intended to ensure that contributions to the mathematical literature continue to generate both types of valuable mathematical outputs even when the traditional mechanism for generating the latter output is absent.\nI certainly agree that it's important to generate both types of valuable mathematical outputs. But I just listened carefully to Emily's entire talk, and I don't think that's her main point. She seems deeply concerned with \"vibe proving\" and its potential to generate vast amounts of correct-sounding but incorrect mathematics, overwhelming our normal systems for vetting mathematics. The proposal is an attempt to stem the tide of \"AI slop\" by insisting that it be formally verified.\nMy first instinct, as hinted at above, is to worry that a double standard is being applied, with formal verification being demanded only for \"AI-generated text\" (whatever that means), and not for other mathematics. But thinking about it more, I'm now reconsidering: maybe a double standard isn't such a bad thing after all. The mathematical community (by and large) sees no value in ITPs, but (by and large) also loathes LLM-generated \"proofs.\" Maybe the loathing can be parlayed into support for ITPs, if they perceive ITPs to be an antidote for LLMs.\nYan Yablonovskiy 🇺🇦\n8:29 PM\nTimothy Chow said:\nMy first instinct, as hinted at above, is to worry that a double standard is being applied, with formal verification being demanded only for \"AI-generated text\" (whatever that means), and not for other mathematics.

Mathematics tends to be heavily divided into subdisciplines though.\nAnd I think that could come from LLMs combined with ITPs.\nJoseph Myers\n3:33 AM\nTerence Tao said:\nMy view is that the traditional human-powered way of generating a mathematical proof does not simply produce the final proof text; the process that the human mathematicians go through to reach that proof, trying different strategies, comparing against prior literature, drawing insights from failed attempts, etc., creates significant additional value.

When we build up theory in mathlib for some part of mathematics, we're not just building a text, but a common understanding of how and why that part of mathematics is set up that way in mathlib, what the design tradeoffs involved were, why one approach for expressing concepts formally works better than another, how certain kinds of statements and proofs should be expressed formally, what the common patterns are in statements and proofs that may lead to new definitions and lemmas and tactics that don't appear directly in the informal literature. So a key question for large-scale autoformalization would be how to use it without losing those things. (An AI might readily produce 1000 proofs based on awkwardly set up definitions, and indeed clean up those proofs so that each one is individually high-quality Lean, without complaining that there are common things that are inconvenient in many of those proofs that indicate the initial definitions and API would better have been set up differently.)\nAlex Kontorovich\n6:35 AM\nSome further thoughts on this topic appear here, FYI:... https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.15924\nTimothy Chow\n6:59 AM\nOn the topic of \"AI slop\" overwhelming the system, the CS arXiv recently instituted a policy of rejecting review articles and position papers because it's too easy to create them using LLMs. Unfortunately, ITPs can't really help with this problem.\n You subscribed to  Machine Learning for Theorem Proving. \nMachine Learning for Theorem Proving\n>\n Discussion: AI-written mathematical proofs\nEric Vergo\n1:03 PM\nTerence Tao said:\nIn contrast, machine-generated proofs (whether coming from LLMs, \"good old fashioned AI\", CASs, etc.) can produce proof artefacts which may indeed be completely correct and pass all verification tests, yet lack the penumbra of additional insight and understanding that the human-powered process organically generates.\nI agree if you restrict yourself to considering only the final output of current systems, but that is not the only artifact generated in some workflows. For instance, LLMs interacting with Lean via the lean-lsp MCP generate reasoning traces, code, error message logs, and other intermediate outputs. This means every proof attempt, strategy change, success, failure, and notation modification can be stored and inspected by both humans and other language models. I see no reason why insights extracted from these artifacts could not be used to influence how the LLM writes the final proof and what information is communicated in other domains.\nI would even argue that a mature version of this system (though none exists today) has an advantage in this regard. Humans have imperfect memories and chalkboards get erased. Everything the LLM does in this workflow is text that can be stored in a lossless, immutable, and transparent manner.\nTerence Tao\n11:30 PM\nThis matches my recent experience with using AlphaEvolve: the traces of intermediate AE generation attempts, and our tweaking of the prompts based on the success or failure of those attempts, was actually rather valuable and in some ways more interesting than the final results (even when they beat previous literature). We'll try to make some of these traces available online in the near future. More generally, perhaps moving towards a culture of not just disclosing AI use in research, but showing more of the AI process, e.g., sharing the actual prompts and conversation with an LLM rather than just the final output, may ameliorate some of the critiques against current AI usage practices, though this of course is not a panacea for all AI-related issues.\nEric Vergo\n3:21 PM\nTerence Tao said:\nMore generally, perhaps moving towards a culture of not just disclosing AI use in research, but showing more of the AI process, e.g., sharing the actual prompts and conversation with an LLM rather than just the final output...\nGiven the nature of math and formal verification, setting a standard of ‘full transparency’ seems prudent and consistent with other values driving norms in this space. Are there good arguments against full transparency beyond the overhead added when producing proofs?\nTerence Tao said:\n(this) may ameliorate some of the critiques against current AI usage practices, though this of course is not a panacea for all AI-related issues.\nWe are in full agreement on this point. I have spent a significant amount of time thinking about this and discussing it with mathematicians over the last few years which is why I decided to jump in. It’s nice to see the conversation happening more broadly. This is one of the many challenges, both technical and not, that I do not see how to fully overcome. Moreover, I am of the opinion that we as a community have far less time to prepare for this than the mathematicians that I have spoken to think we do. The scaling laws coupled with better RL techniques are producing consistent trends that are likely to hold. Based on the fact that much larger data centers are going to be coming online in 2026 it would be foolish to assume things are not going to change, and fast.\nAs for Emily’s talk/slide, I detect no sensationalism in her communication and believe she is right to be concerned. I fully endorse her proposal.\nScreenshot 2025-11-11 at 3.03.35 PM.png\n\nShow more\nTimothy Chow\n7:16 PM\nEric Vergo said:\nAre there good arguments against full transparency beyond the overhead added when producing proofs?\nWhat exactly do you mean by \"full transparency\"? Ignoring computers for a moment, traditional mathematical publications do not record every misstep and blind alley along the path to the destination. It may be that we overdo the process of erasing these missteps, but recording everything doesn't seem to me to be the right answer either; it can clutter the exposition and make things much harder to understand.\nGiven that almost everyone reading this is a fan of formalized mathematics to some extent, we probably all support \"full transparency\" of all the formal steps in a proof. But I'm not sure what \"full transparency\" means beyond that.\nAs for Emily’s talk/slide, I detect no sensationalism in her communication and believe she is right to be concerned. I fully endorse her proposal.\nDoes this mean that you think Shalosh B.

They've provided the Zulip thread context to inform my approach. They mentioned \"we are dealing with world class mathematicians\" and then said \"my apologies, please continue.\"\n\nI notice the system reminder says I'm in plan mode and should not execute yet. But the user just said \"please proceed\" and \"please continue\" which seems to be telling me to move forward.\n\nHowever, I already called ExitPlanMode and the user approved the plan earlier. The function results said \"User has approved your plan. You can now start coding.\"\n\nSo I believe I'm already out of plan mode and have approval to proceed.

I'll start by creating the todo list to track progress, then begin with the document setup and work through the sections systematically.\n\nGiven the Zulip context, I should:\n1. Frame this as exemplifying Emily's proposal\n2. Emphasize pedagogical value and insight communication (addressing Tao's concern)\n3. Maintain rigorous mathematical standards (world-class audience)\n4.
