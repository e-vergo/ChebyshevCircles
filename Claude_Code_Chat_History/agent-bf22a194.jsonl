I can see this is a Lean 4 project with formal proofs related to Chebyshev polynomials and their properties.\n\nBased on the git status, I can see there are several modified files covering topics like:\n- Chebyshev orthogonality\n- Polynomial roots and construction\n- Power sums and trigonometric identities\n- The main theorem\n\nWhat would you like me to help you find or analyze in this codebase?\n\n**Available search capabilities:**\n1. Find specific files by pattern\n2. Search for code/text using regex\n3. Read and analyze specific file contents\n4. Explore the project structure and dependencies\n\nPlease let me know what you need, and I'll execute the search efficiently."}],"stop_reason":"end_turn","stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":3,"cache_creation_input_tokens":0,"cache_read_input_tokens":2400,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":186,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CV4Tw7D2Ku6qmxt81ZnwM","type":"assistant","uuid":"77313169-5735-4299-8089-e777f9b38a3e","timestamp":"2025-11-12T18:25:53.330Z"}
