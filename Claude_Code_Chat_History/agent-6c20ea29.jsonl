Here are some options:\n\n**1.** Complete proofs in `MainTheorem.lean` (remove any `sorry` statements)\n**2.** Review and integrate work from scratch files\n**3.** Search for and apply relevant Mathlib lemmas\n**4.** Analyze proof state for a specific theorem\n**5.** Something else (please specify)\n\nPlease select an option or describe what you'd like to accomplish."}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":3,"cache_creation_input_tokens":2254,"cache_read_input_tokens":0,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":2254,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":241,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CUwkwWQVPUwCYHZytTN3B","type":"assistant","uuid":"8fae062c-6ffc-4dbd-9b7d-0b1dd6a3ca18","timestamp":"2025-11-09T05:24:46.812Z"}
