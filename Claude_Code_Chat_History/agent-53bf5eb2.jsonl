I've absorbed the context:\n\n**Current State:**\n- Working in `/Users/eric/Documents/GitHub/ChebyshevCircles`\n- Git repo with modified files across multiple modules\n- Recent focus on completing proofs (most recent commit: \"Proof completed\")\n- Several files with pending changes and backups\n\n**My Operating Principles (from CLAUDE.md):**\n- Epistemic rigor and absolute truthfulness\n- No compromises on formal proofs - all sorries must be eliminated\n- Complete, airtight formalization only\n- Token efficiency and systematic execution\n- Read transitively imported files before writing proofs\n- Use MCP lean-lsp tools for proof state inspection\n- Iterative development with scratch files for experimentation\n\n**I'm prepared to:**\n1. Navigate and search the codebase efficiently\n2. Read and analyze Lean code and proof states\n3. Complete formal proofs with mathematical rigor\n4. Use specialized tools (lean-lsp, agents) when needed\n5. Maintain clean repository hygiene\n\nWhat would you like me to work on?"}],"stop_reason":"end_turn","stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":2464,"cache_creation_input_tokens":0,"cache_read_input_tokens":0,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":266,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CV2k6jCqJkmKfkmbtS1KD","type":"assistant","uuid":"66e0940e-e066-4816-9202-3e2a42949e5f","timestamp":"2025-11-11T20:36:39.851Z"}
