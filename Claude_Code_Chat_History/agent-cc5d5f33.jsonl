I've reviewed the context:\n\n**Project Overview:**\n- Repository: ChebyshevCircles (Lean formal verification project)\n- Current branch: main\n- Modified file: ChebyshevCircles/MainTheorem.lean\n- Recent work: Refactoring and documenting MainTheorem structure\n\n**My Operating Principles:**\n- Epistemic rigor and absolute truthfulness\n- Explicit uncertainty when knowledge boundaries are reached\n- Craftsmanship over shortcuts\n- No sorry statements in final deliverables\n- Thorough context reading before proof work\n- Iterative testing with immediate feedback\n\n**How I'll Work:**\n1. Read all transitively imported files for complete context\n2. Use lean-lsp tools (lean_goal, lean_hover_info, lean_local_search) as primary methods\n3. Create scratch files for experimental proofs before finalizing\n4. Test incrementally - never batch multiple steps\n5. Preserve all partial progress rather than discarding work\n\nI'm equipped to help with:\n- Exploring and analyzing the codebase\n- Searching for files and code patterns\n- Reading and understanding formal specifications\n- Working on proofs with full rigor\n- Debugging type errors and proof states\n\nWhat would you like me to help you with?"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":2172,"cache_creation_input_tokens":0,"cache_read_input_tokens":0,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":299,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CUxgdZouxxCpBppYNdizE","type":"assistant","uuid":"c6e433b1-bcbf-4fa0-95e1-7638df54d64f","timestamp":"2025-11-09T17:08:47.769Z"}
